      <title>Chapter Objectives</title>
      <p>By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognize central limit theorem problems</li>
        <li>Classify continuous word problems by their distributions</li>
        <li>Apply and interpret the central limit theorem for means</li>
        <li>Apply and interpret the central limit theorem for sums</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>

    <p>Why are we so concerned with means? Two reasons are they give us a middle ground for comparison, and they are easy to calculate. In this chapter, you will study means and the <em>central limit theorem</em>.</p>

    <p>The central limit theorem (clt) is one of the most powerful and useful ideas in all of statistics. There are two alternative forms of the theorem, and both alternatives are concerned with drawing a finite samples size <m>n</m> from a population with a known mean, <m>\mu</m>, and a known standard deviation, <m>\sigma</m>. The first alternative says that if we collect samples of size <m>n</m> with a <em>large enough n</em>, calculate each sample's mean, and create a histogram of those means, then the resulting histogram will tend to have an approximate normal bell shape. The second alternative says that if we again collect samples of size n that are <em>large enough</em>, calculate the sum of each sample and create a histogram, then the resulting histogram will again tend to have a normal bell shape. The central limit theorem for sample means is more discussed in the world of statistics, but it is important to note that taking each sample's sum and graphing the sums will also result in a normal histogram. There are instances where one wishes to calculate the sum of a sample, as opposed to its mean.</p>

    <p><em>In either case, it does not matter what the distribution of the original population is, or whether you even need to know it. The important fact is that the distributions of sample means and the sums tend to follow the normal distribution.</em></p>

    <p>The size of the sample, <m>n</m>, that is required in order to be <em>large enough</em> depends on the original population from which the samples are drawn (the sample size should be at least 30 or the data should come from a normal distribution). If the original population is far from normal, then more observations are needed for the sample means or sums to be normal. <em>Sampling is done with replacement</em>.</p>

    <exploration xml:id="ch7-intro-exploration">
      <title>Collaborative Classroom Activity</title>
      
      <p>Suppose eight of you roll one fair die ten times, seven of you roll two fair dice ten times, nine of you roll five fair dice ten times, and 11 of you roll ten fair dice ten times.</p>

      <p>Each time a person rolls more than one die, he or she calculates the sample mean of the faces showing. For example, one person might roll five fair dice and get 2, 2, 3, 4, and 6 on one roll.</p>

      <p>The mean is <m>\frac{2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6}{5} = 3.4</m>. The 3.4 is one mean when five fair dice are rolled. This same person would roll the five dice nine more times and calculate nine more means for a total of ten means.</p>

      <p>Your instructor will pass out the dice to several people. Roll your dice ten times. For each roll, record the faces, and find the mean. Round to the nearest 0.5.</p>

      <p>Your instructor (and possibly you) will produce one graph (it might be a histogram) for one die, one graph for two dice, one graph for five dice, and one graph for ten dice. Because the <em>mean</em> when you roll one die is just the face on the die, what distribution do these <em>means</em> appear to be representing?</p>

      <p><em>Draw the graph for the means using two dice.</em> Do the sample means show any kind of pattern?</p>

      <p><em>Draw the graph for the means using five dice.</em> Do you see any pattern emerging?</p>

      <p><em>Finally, draw the graph for the means using ten dice.</em> Do you see any pattern to the graph? What can you conclude as you increase the number of dice?</p>

      <p>As the number of dice rolled increases from one to two to five to ten, the following is happening:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The mean of the sample means remains approximately the same.</li>
        <li>The spread of the sample means (the standard deviation of the sample means) gets smaller.</li>
        <li>The graph appears steeper and thinner.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You have just demonstrated the central limit theorem (clt).</p>

      <p>The central limit theorem tells you that as you increase the number of dice, <em>the sample means tend toward a normal distribution (the sampling distribution)</em>.</p>

<section xml:id="ch7-fs-id1164565418890"><title>The Central Limit Theorem for Sample Means (Averages)</title>

<p>Suppose <em>X</em> is a random variable with a distribution that may be known or unknown (it can be any distribution). Using a subscript that matches the random variable, suppose</p>

<ol>
<li><m>\mu_x</m> = the mean of <em>X</em></li>
<li><m>\sigma_x</m> = the standard deviation of <em>X</em></li>
</ol>

<p>If you draw random samples of size <em>n</em>, then as <em>n</em> increases, the random variable <m>\overline{X}</m>, which consists of sample means, tends to be normally distributed and</p>

<me>
\overline{X} \sim N\left(\mu_x, \frac{\sigma_x}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
</me>

<p>The central limit theorem for sample means says that if you keep drawing larger and larger samples (such as rolling one, two, five, and finally, ten dice) and <em>calculating their means</em>, the sample means form their own <em>normal distribution</em> (the sampling distribution). The normal distribution has the same mean as the original distribution and a variance that equals the original variance divided by the sample size. The variable <em>n</em> is the number of values that are averaged together, not the number of times the experiment is done.</p>

<p>To put it more formally, if you draw random samples of size <em>n</em>, the distribution of the random variable <m>\overline{X}</m>, which consists of sample means, is called the <em>sampling distribution of the mean</em>. The sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as <em>n</em>, the sample size, increases.</p>

<p>The random variable <m>\overline{X}</m> has a different <em>z</em>-score associated with it from that of the random variable <em>X</em>. The mean <m>\overline{x}</m> is the value of <m>\overline{X}</m> in one sample.</p>

<me>
z = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu_x}{\left(\frac{\sigma_x}{\sqrt{n}}\right)},
</me>

<p><em>μ<m>_X</m></em> is the average of both <em>X</em> and <m>\overline{X}</m>.</p>

<p><m>\sigma_{\overline{x}} = \frac{\sigma_x}{\sqrt{n}}</m> = standard deviation of <m>\overline{X}</m> and is called the standard error of the mean.</p>

<p>b. To find the value that is two standard deviations above the expected value 90, use the following formula</p>

value = \mu_x + (\#ofSTDEVs)\left(\frac{\sigma_x}{\sqrt{n}}\right)

<statement>
<p>A gaming marketing gap for men between the ages of 30 to 40 has been identified. You are researching a startup game targeted at the 35-year-old demographic. Your idea is to develop a strategy game that can be played by men from their late 20s through their late 30s. Based on the article's data, industry research shows that the average strategy player is 28 years old with a standard deviation of 4.8 years. You take a sample of 100 randomly selected gamers.

<p>The mean number of minutes for app engagement by a tablet user is 8.2 minutes. Suppose the standard deviation is one minute. Take a sample of 60.</p>

<title>The Central Limit Theorem for Sums</title>

<p>Suppose <em>X</em> is a random variable with a distribution that may be <em>known or unknown</em> (it can be any distribution) and suppose:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>μ<m>_X</m></em> = the mean of <em>Χ</em></li>
<li><em>σ<m>_Χ</m></em> = the standard deviation of <em>X</em></li>
</ol>

<p>If you draw random samples of size <em>n</em>, then as <em>n</em> increases, the random variable Σ<em>X</em> consisting of sums tends to be normally distributed and Σ<em>Χ</em> ~ <em>N</em>[(<em>n</em>)(<em>μ<m>_Χ</m></em>), (<m>\sqrt{n}</m>)(<em>σ<m>_Χ</m></em>)].</p>

<p><em>The</em> central limit theorem for sums says that if you keep drawing larger and larger samples and taking their sums, the sums form their own normal distribution (the sampling distribution), which approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. <em>The normal distribution has a mean equal to the original mean multiplied by the sample size and a standard deviation equal to the original standard deviation multiplied by the square root of the sample size.</em></p>

<p>The random variable Σ<em>X</em> has the following <em>z</em>-score associated with it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Σ<em>x</em> is one sum.</li>
<li><m>z = \frac{\Sigma x - (n)(\mu_X)}{(\sqrt{n})(\sigma_X)}</m>
<ol>
<li>(<em>n</em>)(<em>μ<m>_X</m></em>) = mean of Σ<em>X</em></li>

  <title>Using the Central Limit Theorem</title>

  <subsection xml:id="ch7-fs-id1164565575770">
    <p>It is important for you to understand when to use the central limit theorem. If you are being asked to find the probability of the mean, use the clt for the means. If you are being asked to find the probability of a sum or total, use the clt for sums. This also applies to percentiles for means and sums.</p>
    <note>
      <title>NOTE</title>
      <p>If you are being asked to find the probability of an <em>individual</em> value, do <em>not</em> use the clt. <em>Use the distribution of its random variable.</em></p>

    <title>Examples of the Central Limit Theorem</title>
    <subsection xml:id="ch7-fs-idp5962992">
      <title>Law of Large Numbers</title>
      <p>The law of large numbers says that if you take samples of larger and larger sizes from any population, then the mean <m>\overline{x}</m> of the samples tends to get closer and closer to <em>μ</em>. From the central limit theorem, we know that as <em>n</em> gets larger and larger, the sample means follow a normal distribution. The larger <em>n</em> gets, the smaller the standard deviation gets. (Remember that the standard deviation for <m>\overline{X}</m> is <m>\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m>.) This means that the sample mean <m>\overline{x}</m> must be close to the population mean <em>μ</em>. We can say that <em>μ</em> is the value that the sample means approach as <em>n</em> gets larger. The central limit theorem illustrates the law of large numbers.</p>

      <title>Central Limit Theorem for the Mean and Sum Examples</title>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>A study involving stress is conducted among the students on a college campus. <em>The stress scores follow a uniform distribution</em> with the lowest stress score equal to one and the highest equal to five. Using a sample of 75 students, find:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>the probability that the <em>mean stress score</em> for the 75 students is less than 2</li>
            <li>the 90<m>^{th}</m> percentile for the <em>mean stress score</em> for the 75 students</li>
            <li>the probability that the <em>total of the 75 stress scores</em> is less than 200</li>
            <li>the 90<m>^{th}</m> percentile for the <em>total stress score</em> for the 75 students</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Let <em>X</em> = one stress score.</p>
          <p>Problems (a) and (b) ask you to find a probability or a percentile for a mean. Problems (c) and (d) ask you to find a probability or a percentile for a <em>total or sum</em>. The sample size, <em>n</em>, is equal to 75.</p>
          <p>Because the individual stress scores follow a uniform distribution, <em>X</em> ~ <em>U</em>(1, 5) where <em>a</em> = 1 and <em>b</em> = 5 (see Continuous Random Variables for an explanation of a uniform distribution),</p>
          <me>\mu_{X}\text{ =}\frac{a+b}{2}=\frac{1 + 5}{2}=3</me>
          <me>\sigma_{X}\text{ =}\sqrt{\frac{{(b-a)}^{2}}{12}}=\sqrt{\frac{{(5-1)}^{2}}{12}}\text{ = 1}\text{.15}</me>
          <p>In the formula above, the denominator is understood to be 12, regardless of the endpoints of the uniform distribution.</p>
          <p>For problems (a) and (b), let <m>\overline{X}</m> = the mean stress score for the 75 students. Then,</p>
          <me>\overline{X}\text{ ~ }N (3, \frac{1.15}{\sqrt{75}})\text{ where }n\text{ = 75}\text{.}</me>
          <p>For problems (c) and (d), let <em>ΣX</em> = the sum of the 75 stress scores. Then, <em>ΣX</em> ~ <em>N</em>[(75)(3),<m>(\sqrt{75})</m>(1.15)].</p>

        <title>HISTORICAL NOTE</title>
        <p><em>Normal Approximation to the Binomial</em></p>
        <p>Historically, being able to compute binomial probabilities was one of the most important applications of the central limit theorem. Binomial probabilities with a small value for <em>n</em> (say, 20) were displayed in a table in a book. To calculate the probabilities with large values of <em>n</em>,  you had to use the binomial formula, which could be very complicated. Using the <em>normal approximation to the binomial</em> distribution simplified the process. To compute the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, take a simple random sample from a population. You must meet the following conditions for a binomial distribution:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There are a certain number, <em>n</em>, of independent trials.</li>
          <li>The outcomes of any trial are success or failure.</li>
          <li>Each trial has the same probability of a success, <em>p</em>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Recall that if <em>X</em> is the binomial random variable, then <em>X</em> ~ <em>B</em>(<em>n, p</em>). The shape of the binomial distribution needs to be
similar to the shape of the normal distribution. To ensure this, the quantities <em>np</em>
and <em>nq</em> must both be greater than five (<em>np</em> &gt; 5 and <em>nq</em> > 5;  the approximation is better if they are both greater than or equal to 10. The product &gt;5 is more or less accepted as the norm here.). This is another accepted rule. So, for whatever value of <em>x</em> we are looking at (the number of successes). We add 0.5 if we are looking for the probability that is less than or equal to that number. We subtract 0.5 if we are looking for the probability that is greater than or equal to that number. Then the binomial can be approximated by the normal distribution with mean <em>μ</em> = <em>np</em> and standard deviation <em>σ</em> = <m>\sqrt{npq}</m>. Remember that <em>q</em> = 1 – <em>p</em>. In order to get the best approximation, add 0.5 to <em>x</em> or subtract 0.5 from <em>x</em> (use <em>x</em> + 0.5 or <em>x</em> – 0.5).</p>
        <p>This is another accepted rule. So, for whatever value of <em>x</em> we are looking at (the number of successes). We add 0.5 if we are looking for the probability that is less than or equal to that number. We subtract 0.5 if we are looking for the probability that is greater than or equal to that number. The number 0.5 is called the continuity correction factor and is used in the following example.</p>
      </note>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>Suppose in a local kindergarten through 12<m>^{th}</m> grade (K12) school district, 53 percent of the population favor a charter school for grades K through 5. A simple random sample of 300 is surveyed.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Find the probability that <em>at least 150</em> favor a charter school.</li>
            <li>Find the probability that <em>at most 160</em> favor a charter school.</li>
            <li>Find the probability that <em>more than 155</em> favor a charter school.</li>
            <li>Find the probability that <em>fewer than 147</em> favor a charter school.</li>
            <li>Find the probability that <em>exactly 175</em> favor a charter school.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Let <em>X</em> = the number that favor a charter school for grades K through 5. <em>X</em> ~ <em>B</em>(<em>n, p</em>) where <em>n</em> = 300 and <em>p</em> = 0.53. Because <em>np</em> &gt; 5 and <em>nq</em> &gt; 5, use the normal approximation to the binomial. The formulas for the mean and standard deviation are <em>μ</em> = <em>np</em> and <em>σ</em> = <m>\sqrt{npq}</m>. The mean is 159, and the standard deviation is 8.6447. The random variable for the normal distribution is <em>Y</em>. <em>Y</em> ~ <em>N</em>(159, 8.6447). See The Normal Distribution for help with calculator instructions.</p>
          <p>For Part (a), you <em>include 150</em> so <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> ≥ 150) has a normal approximation <em>P</em>(<em>Y</em> ≥ 149.5) = 0.8641.</p>
          <p><c>normalcdf</c>(149.5,10^99,159,8.6447) = 0.8641.</p>
          <p>For Part (b), you <em>include 160</em> so <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> ≤ 160) has a normal approximation <em>P</em>(<em>Y</em> ≤ 160.5) = 0.5689.</p>
          <p><c>normalcdf</c>(0,160.5,159,8.6447) = 0.5689</p>
          <p>For Part (c), you <em>exclude 155</em> so <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> &gt; 155) has normal approximation <em>P</em>(<em>y</em> &gt; 155.5) = 0.6572.</p>
          <p><c>normalcdf</c>(155.5,10^99,159,8.6447) = 0.6572.</p>
          <p>For Part (d), you <em>exclude 147</em> so <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> &lt; 147) has normal approximation <em>P</em>(<em>Y</em> &lt; 146.5) = 0.0741.</p>
          <p><c>normalcdf</c>(0,146.5,159,8.6447) = 0.0741</p>
          <p>For Part (e), <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> = 175) has normal approximation <em>P</em>(174.5 &lt; <em>Y</em> &lt; 175.5) = 0.0083.</p>
          <p><c>normalcdf</c>(174.5,175.5,159,8.6447) = 0.0083</p>
          <p>Because of calculators and computer software that let you calculate binomial probabilities for large values of <em>n</em> easily, it is not necessary to use the the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, provided that you have access to these technology tools. Most school labs have computer software that calculates binomial probabilities. Many students have access to calculators that calculate probabilities for binomial distribution. If you type in <em>binomial probability distribution calculation</em> in an internet browser, you can find at least one online calculator for the binomial.</p>
          <p>For , the  probabilities are calculated using the following binomial distribution: (<em>n</em> = 300 and <em>p</em> = 0.53). Compare the binomial and normal distribution answers. See Discrete Random Variables for help with calculator instructions for the binomial.</p>
          <p><em>P</em>(<em>X</em> ≥ 150) :<c>1 - binomialcdf</c>(300,0.53,149) = 0.8641</p>

        <p>Your company has a contract to perform preventive maintenance on thousands of air conditioners in a large city. Based on service records from previous years, the time that a technician spends servicing a unit averages one hour with a standard deviation of one hour. In the coming week, your company will service a simple random sample of 70 units in the city. You plan to budget an average of 1.1 hours per technician to complete the work. Will this be enough time?</p>

        <p>Use <c>normalcdf</c><m>(E-\text{99,1}\text{.1,1,}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\text{70}}})</m> = 0.7986. This means that there is an 80 percent chance that the service time will be less than 1.1 hours. It may be wise to schedule more time because there is an associated 20 percent chance that the maintenance time will be greater than 1.1 hours.</p>

      <title>central limit theorem</title>
      <p>given a random variable (RV) with a known mean, <m>\mu</m>, and known standard deviation, <m>\sigma</m>, and sampling with size <m>n</m>, we are interested in two new RVs: the sample mean, <m>\overline{X}</m>, and the sample sum, <m>\Sigma X</m></p>
      <p>If the size (<m>n</m>) of the sample is sufficiently large, then <m>\overline{X} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)</m> and <m>\Sigma X \sim N(n\mu, \sqrt{n}\sigma)</m>. If the size (<m>n</m>) of the sample is sufficiently large, then the distribution of the sample means and the distribution of the sample sums will approximate a normal distribution regardless of the shape of the population. The mean of the sample means will equal the population mean, and the mean of the sample sums will equal <m>n</m> times the population mean. The standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means, <m>\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m>, is called the standard error of the mean</p>

      <title>normal distribution</title>
      <p>a continuous random variable (RV) with probability density function (pdf) <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}</m>, where <m>\mu</m> is the mean of the distribution and <m>\sigma</m> is the standard deviation; notation: <m>X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)</m>. If <m>\mu = 0</m> and <m>\sigma = 1</m>, the RV is called a <em>standard normal distribution</em></p>
