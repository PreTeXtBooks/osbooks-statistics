    <p>Once you have a data collection, what will you do with it?  Data can be described and presented in many different formats. For example, suppose you are interested in buying a house in a particular area.  You may have no clue about the house prices, so you might ask your real estate agent to give you a sample data set of prices. Looking at all the prices in the sample often is overwhelming. A better way might be to look at the median price and the variation of prices. The median and variation are just two ways that you will learn to describe data. Your agent might also provide you with a graph of the data.</p>

    <p>In this chapter, you will study numerical and graphical ways to describe and display your data. This area of statistics is called <em>descriptive statistics.</em>  You will learn how to calculate and, even more important, how to interpret these measurements and graphs.</p>

    <p>A statistical graph is a tool that helps you learn about the shape or distribution of a sample or a population. A graph can be a more effective way of presenting data than a mass of numbers because we can see where data values cluster and where there are only a few data values. Newspapers and the internet use graphs to show trends and to enable readers to compare facts and figures quickly. Statisticians often graph data first to get a picture of the data. Then more formal tools may be applied.</p>

    <p>Some of the types of graphs that are used to summarize and organize data are the dot plot, the bar graph, the histogram, the stem-and-leaf plot, the frequency polygon—a type of broken line graph—the pie chart, and the box plot. In this chapter, we will briefly look at stem-and-leaf plots, line graphs, and bar graphs as well as frequency polygons, time series graphs, and dot plots. Our emphasis will be on histograms and box plots.</p>

    <title>Stem-and-Leaf Graphs (Stemplots), Line Graphs, and Bar Graphs</title>
    <p>One simple graph, the <em>stem-and-leaf graph</em> or <em>stemplot</em>, comes from the field of exploratory data analysis. It is a good choice when the data sets are small. To create the plot, divide each observation of data into a stem and a leaf. The stem consists of the leading digit(s), while the leaf consists of a <term>final significant digit</term>. For example, 23 has stem two and leaf three. The number 432 has stem 43 and leaf two. Likewise, the number 5,432 has stem 543 and leaf two. The decimal 9.3 has stem nine and leaf three. Write the stems in a vertical line from smallest to largest. Draw a vertical line to the right of the stems. Then write the leaves in increasing order next to their corresponding stem. Make sure the leaves show a space between values, so that the exact data values may be easily determined. The frequency of data values for each stem provides information about the shape of the distribution.</p>

    <p>The stemplot is a quick way to graph data and gives an exact picture of the data. You want to look for an overall pattern and any outliers. An <term>outlier</term> is an observation of data that does not fit the rest of the data. It is sometimes called an <em>extreme value.</em> When you graph an outlier, it will appear not to fit the pattern of the graph. Some outliers are due to mistakes, for example, writing 50 instead of 500, while others may indicate that something unusual is happening. It takes some background information to explain outliers, so we will cover them in more detail later.</p>

    <p>A <em>stem-and-leaf plot</em> is a way to plot data and look at the distribution. In a stem-and-leaf plot, all data values within a class are visible. The advantage in a stem-and-leaf plot is that all values are listed, unlike a histogram, which gives classes of data values. A <em>line graph</em> is often used to represent a set of data values in which a quantity varies with time. These graphs are useful for finding trends, that is, finding a general pattern in data sets, including temperature, sales, employment, company profit, or cost, over a period of time. A <em>bar graph</em> is a chart that uses either horizontal or vertical bars to show comparisons among categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a discrete value. Bar graphs are especially useful when categorical data are being used.</p>

    <p><em>For each of the following data sets, create a stemplot and identify any outliers.</em></p>

    <title>Histograms, Frequency Polygons, and Time Series Graphs</title>
    <p>For most of the work you do in this book, you will use a histogram to display the data. One advantage of a histogram is that it can readily display large data sets.</p>

    <p>A <term>histogram</term> consists of contiguous (adjoining) boxes. It has both a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. The horizontal axis is more or less a number line, labeled with what the data represents, for example, distance from your home to school. The vertical axis is labeled either <term>frequency</term> or <term>relative frequency</term> (or percent frequency or probability). The graph will have the same shape with either label. The histogram (like the stemplot) can give you the shape of the data, the center, and the spread of the data. The shape of the data refers to the shape of the distribution, whether normal, approximately normal, or skewed in some direction, whereas the center is thought of as the middle of a data set, and the spread indicates how far the values are dispersed about the center. In a skewed distribution, the mean is pulled toward the tail of the distribution.</p>

    <p>The relative frequency is equal to the frequency for an observed value of the data divided by the total number of data values in the sample. Remember, frequency is defined as the number of times an answer occurs. If</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>f</em> = frequency,</p></li>
      <li><p><em>n</em> = total number of data values (or the sum of the individual frequencies), and</p></li>
      <li><p><em>RF</em> = relative frequency,</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>then
<m>

\text{RF}
=\frac{
f
}{
n
}
\text{.}</m>
</p>

    <p>For example, if three students in Mr. Ahab's English class of 40 students received from ninety to 100 percent, then <em>f</em> = 3, <em>n</em> = 40, and <em>RF</em> = <m>\frac{f}{n}</m> = <m>\frac{3}{40}</m> = 0.075. Thus, 7.5 percent of the students received 90 to 100 percent. Ninety to 100 percent is a quantitative measures.</p>

    <p><em>To construct a histogram</em>, first decide how many <em>bars</em> or <em>intervals</em>, also called classes, represent the data. Many histograms consist of five to 15 bars or classes for clarity. The width of each bar is also referred to as the bin size, which may be calculated by dividing the range of the data values by the desired number of bins (or bars). There is not a set procedure for determining the number of bars or bar width/bin size; however, consistency is key when determining which data values to place inside each interval.</p>

    <example xml:id="exampid1">

      <statement>

        <p>The following data are the heights (in inches to the nearest half inch) of 100 male semiprofessional soccer players. The heights are <em>continuous</em> data since height is measured.

60, 60.5, 61, 61, 61.5,

63.5, 63.5, 63.5,

64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64.5, 64.5, 64.5, 64.5, 64.5, 64.5, 64.5, 64.5,

66, 66, 66, 66, 66, 66, 66, 66, 66, 66, 66.5, 66.5, 66.5, 66.5, 66.5, 66.5, 66.5, 66.5, 66.5, 66.5, 66.5, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67.5, 67.5, 67.5, 67.5, 67.5, 67.5, 67.5,

68, 68, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69.5, 69.5, 69.5, 69.5, 69.5,

70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70.5, 70.5, 70.5, 71, 71, 71,

72, 72, 72, 72.5, 72.5, 73, 73.5,

74
</p>
      <p>The smallest data value is 60, and the largest data value is 74. To make sure each is included in an interval, we can use 59.95 as the smallest value and 74.05 as the largest value, subtracting and adding .05 to these values, respectively. We have a small range here of 14.1 (74.05 – 59.95), so we will want a fewer number of bins; let's say eight. So, 14.1 divided by eight bins gives a bin size (or interval size) of approximately 1.76.</p>
      <note xml:id="id7476385">
        <title>NOTE</title>
        <p>We will round up to two and make each bar or class interval two units wide. Rounding up to two  is a way to prevent a value from falling on a boundary. Rounding to the next number is often necessary even if it goes against the standard rules of rounding. For this example, using 1.76 as the width would also work. A guideline that is followed by some for the width of a bar or class interval is to take the square root of the number of data values and then round to the nearest whole number, if necessary. For example, if there are 150 values of data, take the square root of 150 and round to 12 bars or intervals.</p>
      </note>
      <p>The boundaries are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>59.95</p></li>
        <li><p>59.95 + 2 = 61.95</p></li>
        <li><p>61.95 + 2 = 63.95</p></li>
        <li><p>63.95 + 2 = 65.95</p></li>
        <li><p>65.95 + 2 = 67.95</p></li>
        <li><p>67.95 + 2 = 69.95</p></li>

            <p>The smallest data value is 1, and the largest data value is 6. To make sure each is included in an interval, we can use 0.5 as the smallest value and 6.5 as the largest value by subtracting and adding 0.5 to these values. We have a small range here of 6 (6.5 – 0.5), so we will want a fewer number of bins; let's say six this time. So, six divided by six bins gives a bin size (or interval size) of one.</p>

      <title>Frequency Polygons</title>

    <p>Frequency polygons are analogous to line graphs, and just as line graphs make continuous data visually easy to interpret, so too do frequency polygons.</p>

    <p>To construct a frequency polygon, first examine the data and decide on the number of intervals and resulting interval size, for both the <em>x</em>-axis and <em>y</em>-axis. The <em>x</em>-axis will show the lower and upper bound for each interval, containing the data values, whereas the <em>y</em>-axis will represent the frequencies of the values. Each data point represents the frequency for each interval. For example, if an interval has three data values in it, the frequency polygon will show a 3 at the upper endpoint of that interval. After choosing the appropriate intervals, begin plotting the data points. After all the points are plotted, draw line segments to connect them.</p>

      <p>Notice that each point represents frequency for a particular interval. These points are located halfway between the lower bound and upper bound. In fact, the horizontal axis, or <em>x</em>-axis, shows only these midpoint values. For the interval 49.5–59.5 the value 54.5 is represented by a point, showing the correct frequency of 5. For the interval occurring before 49.5–59.5, (as well as 39.5–49.5), the value of the midpoint, or 44.5, is represented by a point, showing a frequency of 0, since we do not have any values in that range. The same idea applies to the last interval of 99.5–109.5, which has a midpoint of 104.5 and correctly shows a point representing a frequency of 0. Looking at the graph, we say
that this distribution is skewed because one side of the graph does not mirror the other side.</p>

Since there are no ages less than 41.5, this interval is used only to allow the graph to touch the <em>x</em>-axis. The point labeled 44 represents the next interval, or the first <em>real</em> interval from the table, and contains four scores. This reasoning is followed for each of the remaining intervals with the point 74 representing the interval from 71.5 to 76.5. Again, this interval contains no data and is used only so that the graph will touch the <em>x</em>-axis.

    <p>Suppose that we want to study the temperature range of a region for an entire month. Every day at noon, we note the temperature and write this down in a log. A variety of statistical studies could be done with these data. We could find the mean or the median temperature for the month. We could construct a histogram displaying the number of days that temperatures reach a certain range of values. However, all of these methods ignore a portion of the data that we have collected.</p>

    <p>One feature of the data that we may want to consider is that of time. Since each date is paired with the temperature reading for the day, we don't have to think of the data as being random. We can instead use the times given to impose a chronological order on the data. A graph that recognizes this ordering and displays the changing temperature as the month progresses is called a time series graph.</p>

      <title>Constructing a Time Series Graph</title>

    <p>To construct a time series graph, we must look at both pieces of our <term>paired data set</term>. We start with a standard Cartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis is used to plot the date or time increments, and the vertical axis is used to plot the values of the variable that we are measuring. By using the axes in that way, we make each point on the graph correspond to a date and a measured quantity. The points on the graph are typically connected by straight lines in the order in which they occur.</p>

      <title>Uses of a Time Series Graph</title>
    <p>Time series graphs are important tools in various applications of statistics. When a researcher records values of the same variable over an extended period of time, it is sometimes difficult for him or her to discern any trend or pattern. However, once the same data points are displayed graphically, some features jump out. Time series graphs make trends easy to spot.</p>

    <p>A <em>histogram</em> is a graphic version of a frequency distribution. The graph consists of bars of equal width drawn adjacent to each other. The horizontal scale represents classes of quantitative data values, and the vertical scale represents frequencies. The heights of the bars correspond to frequency values. Histograms are typically used for large, continuous, quantitative data sets. A frequency polygon can also be used when graphing large data sets with data points that repeat. The data usually go on the <em>y</em>-axis with the frequency being graphed on the <em>x</em>-axis. Time series graphs can be helpful when looking at large amounts of data for one variable over a period of time.</p>

    <title>Measures of the Location of the Data</title>
    <p>The common measures of location are <term>quartiles</term> and <term>percentiles</term>.</p>

    <p>Quartiles are special percentiles. The <term>first quartile</term>, <em>Q</em><m>_{1}</m>, is the same as the 25<m>^{th}</m> percentile, and the third quartile, <em>Q</em><m>_{3}</m>, is the same as the 75<m>^{th}</m> percentile. The median, <em>M</em>, is called both the second quartile and the 50<m>^{th}</m> percentile.</p>

    <p>To calculate quartiles and percentiles, you must order the data from smallest to largest. Quartiles divide ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths. Recall that a percent means one-hundredth. So, percentiles mean the data is divided into 100 sections. To score in the 90<m>^{th}</m> percentile of an exam does not mean, necessarily, that you received 90 percent on a test. It means that 90 percent of test scores are the same as or less than your score and that 10 percent of the test scores are the same as or greater than your test score.</p>

    <p>Percentiles are useful for comparing values. For this reason, universities and colleges use percentiles extensively. One instance in which colleges and universities use percentiles is when SAT results are used to determine a minimum testing score that will be used as an acceptance factor. For example, suppose Duke accepts SAT scores at or above the 75<m>^{th}</m> percentile. That translates into a score of at least 1220.</p>

    <p>Percentiles are mostly used with very large populations. Therefore, if you were to say that 90 percent of the test scores are less, and not the same or less, than your score, it would be acceptable because removing one particular data value is not significant. </p>

    <p>The <term>median</term> is a number that measures the <em>center</em> of the data. You can think of the median as the <em>middle value</em>, but it does not actually have to be one of the observed values. It is a number that separates ordered data into halves. Half the values are the same number or smaller than the median, and half the values are the same number or larger. For example, consider the following data:

1, 11.5, 6, 7.2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 6.8, 8.3, 2, 2, 10, 1

Ordered from smallest to largest:

1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6.8, 7.2, 8, 8.3, 9, 10, 10, 11.5</p>

    <p>When a data set has an even number of data values, the median is equal to the average of the two middle values when the data are arranged in ascending order (least to greatest). When a data set has an odd number of data values, the median is equal to the middle value when the data are arranged in ascending order.</p>

    <p>Since there are 14 observations (an even number of data values), the median is between the seventh value, 6.8, and the eighth value, 7.2. To find the median, add the two values together and divide by two.</p>

    <p>The median is seven. Half of the values are smaller than seven and half of the values are larger than seven.</p>

    <p><term>Quartiles</term> are numbers that separate the data into quarters. Quartiles may or may not be part of the data. To find the quartiles, first find the median, or second, quartile. The first quartile, <em>Q</em><m>_{1}</m>, is the middle value of the lower half of the data, and the third quartile, <em>Q</em><m>_{3}</m>, is the middle value, or median, of the upper half of the data. To get the idea, consider the same data set:

1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6.8, 7.2, 8, 8.3, 9, 10, 10, 11.5</p>

    <p>The data set has an even number of values (14 data values), so the median will be the average of the two middle values (the average of 6.8 and 7.2), which is calculated as <m>\frac{6.8+7.2}{2}</m> and equals 7.</p>

    <p>So, the median, or second quartile (<m>Q_{2}</m>), is 7.</p>

    <p>The first quartile is the median of the lower half of the data, so if we divide the data into seven values in the lower half and seven values in the upper half, we can see that we have an odd number of values in the lower half. Thus, the median of the lower half, or the first quartile (<m>Q_{1}</m>) will be the middle value, or 2. Using the same procedure, we can see that the median of the upper half, or the third quartile (<m>Q_{3}</m>) will be the middle value of the upper half, or 9.</p>

    <p>The quartiles are illustrated below:</p>

    <figure xml:id="fs-id1164563168227">
      <image source="media/OSX_HS_Statistics_Figure_02_03_01_01.jpg" width="85%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>The <term>interquartile range</term> is a number that indicates the spread of the middle half, or the middle 50 percent of the data. It is the difference between the third quartile (<em>Q</em><m>_{3}</m>) and the first quartile (<em>Q</em><m>_{1}</m>)</p>

    <p><em>IQR</em> = <em>Q</em><m>_{3}</m> – <em>Q</em><m>_{1}</m>. The <em>IQR</em> for this data set is calculated as 9 minus 2, or 7.</p>

    <p>The <em>IQR</em> can help to determine potential <em>outliers</em>. <em>A value is suspected to be a potential outlier if it is less than 1.5 × <em>IQR</em> below the first quartile or more than 1.5 × <em>IQR</em> above the third quartile</em>. Potential outliers always require further investigation.</p>

    <note xml:id="fs-idm10803744">
      <title>NOTE</title>
      <p>A potential outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the other data points. These special data points may be errors or some kind of abnormality, or they may be a key to understanding the data.</p>

      <p><em>Find the 28<m>^{th}</m> percentile</em>. Notice the .28 in the Cumulative Relative Frequency column. Twenty-eight percent of 50 data values is 14 values. There are 14 values less than the 28<m>^{th}</m> percentile. They include the two 4s, the five 5s, and the seven 6s. The 28<m>^{th}</m> percentile is between the last six and the first seven. <em>The 28<m>^{th}</m> percentile is 6.5.</em></p>
      <p><em>Find the median</em>. Look again at the Cumulative Relative Frequency column and find .52. The median is the 50<m>^{th}</m> percentile or the second quartile. Fifty percent of 50 is 25. There are 25 values less than the median. They include the two 4s, the five 5s, the seven 6s, and 11 of the 7s. The median or 50<m>^{th}</m> percentile is between the 25<m>^{th}</m>, or seven, and 26<m>^{th}</m>, or seven, values. <em>The median is seven.</em></p>
      <p><em>Find the third quartile</em>. The third quartile is the same as the 75<m>^{th}</m> percentile. You can <em>eyeball</em> this answer. If you look at the Cumulative Relative Frequency column, you find .52 and .80. When you have all the fours, fives, sixes, and sevens, you have 52 percent of the data. When you include all the 8s, you have 80 percent of the data. <em>The 75<m>^{th}</m> percentile, then, must be an eight</em>. Another way to look at the problem is to find 75 percent of 50, which is 37.5, and round up to 38. The third quartile, <em>Q</em><m>_{3}</m>, is the 38<m>^{th}</m> value, which is an eight. You can check this answer by counting the values. There are 37 values below the third quartile and 12 values above.</p>

    <p>If you were to do a little research, you would find several formulas for calculating the <em>k</em><m>^{th}</m> percentile. Here is one of them.</p>

    <p><em>k</em> = the <em>k</em><m>^{th}</m> percentile. It may or may not be part of the data.</p>

    <p><em>i</em> = the index (ranking or position of a data value)</p>

      <li><p>Calculate <m>i=\frac{k}{100}(n+1)\text{.}</m></p></li>
      <li><p>If <em>i</em> is an integer, then the <em>k</em><m>^{th}</m> percentile is the data value in the <em>i</em><m>^{th}</m> position in the ordered set of data.</p></li>

      <title>Interpreting Percentiles, Quartiles, and Median</title>

    <p>A percentile indicates the relative standing of a data value when data are sorted into numerical order from smallest to largest. Percentages of data values are less than or equal to the <em>p</em>th percentile. For example, 15 percent of data values are less than or equal to the 15<m>^{th}</m> percentile.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Low percentiles always correspond to lower data values.</p></li>
      <li><p>High percentiles always correspond to higher data values.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>A percentile may or may not correspond to a value judgment about whether it is <em>good</em> or <em>bad</em>. The interpretation of whether a certain percentile is <em>good</em> or <em>bad</em> depends on the context of the situation to which the data apply. In some situations, a low percentile would be considered <em>good;</em> in other contexts a high percentile might be considered <em>good</em>. In many situations, there is no value judgment that applies. A high percentile on a standardized test is considered good, while a lower percentile on body mass index might be considered good. A percentile associated with a person's height doesn't carry any value judgment.</p>

    <p>Understanding how to interpret percentiles properly is important not only when describing data, but also when calculating probabilities in later chapters of this text.</p>

    <p>The values that divide a rank-ordered set of data into 100 equal parts are called percentiles. Percentiles are used to compare and interpret data. For example, an observation at the 50<m>^{th}</m> percentile would be greater than 50 percent of the other observations in the set. Quartiles divide data into quarters. The first quartile (<em>Q</em><m>_{1}</m>) is the 25<m>^{th}</m> percentile, the second quartile (<em>Q</em><m>_{2}</m> or median) is the 50<m>^{th}</m> percentile, and the third quartile (<em>Q</em><m>_{3}</m>) is the 75<m>^{th}</m> percentile. The interquartile range, or <em>IQR</em>, is the range of the middle 50 percent of the data values. The <em>IQR</em> is found by subtracting <em>Q</em><m>_{1}</m> from <em>Q</em><m>_{3}</m> and can help determine outliers by using the following two expressions.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Q</em><m>_{3}</m> + <em>IQR</em>(1.5)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Q</em><m>_{1}</m> – <em>IQR</em>(1.5)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><m>i=(\frac{k}{100})(n+1)</m>
</p>

    <p>where <em>i</em> = the ranking or position of a data value,</p>

    <p><em>k</em> = the <em>k</em>th percentile,</p>

    <p><em>n</em> = total number of data.</p>

    <p>Expression for finding the percentile of a data value<m>(\frac{x\text{ + }0.5y}{n})</m>(100)</p>

    <p><em>y</em> = the number of data values equal to the data value for which you want to find the percentile,</p>

    <title>Box Plots</title>
    <p><term>Box plots</term>, also called <term>box-and-whisker plots</term> or <term>box-whisker plots</term>, give a good graphical image of the concentration of the data. They also show how far the extreme values are from most of the data. As mentioned previously, a box plot is constructed from five values: the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. We use these values to compare how close other data values are to them.</p>

    <p>To construct a box plot, use a horizontal or vertical number line and a rectangular box. The smallest and largest data values label the endpoints of the axis. The first quartile marks one end of the box, and the third quartile marks the other end of the box. Approximately <em>the middle 50 percent of the data fall inside the box.</em> The <em>whiskers</em> extend from the ends of the box to the smallest and largest data values. A box plot easily shows the range of a data set, which is the difference between the largest and smallest data values (or the difference between the maximum and minimum). Unless the median, first quartile, and third quartile are the same value, the median will lie inside the box or between the first and third quartiles. The box plot gives a good, quick picture of the data.</p>

    <note xml:id="eip-724">
      <title>NOTE</title>
      <p>You may encounter box-and-whisker plots that have dots marking outlier values. In those cases, the whiskers are not extending to the minimum and maximum values.</p>
    </note>

    <p>Consider, again, this data set:</p>

    <p>1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6.8, 7.2, 8, 8.3, 9, 10, 10, 11.5
</p>

    <p>The first quartile is two, the median is seven, and the third quartile is nine. The smallest value is one, and the largest value is 11.5. The following image shows the constructed box plot.</p>

    <p>For some sets of data, some of the largest value, smallest value, first quartile, median, and third quartile may be the same. For instance, you might have a data set in which the median and the third quartile are the same. In this case, the diagram would not have a dotted line inside the box displaying the median. The right side of the box would display both the third quartile and the median. For example, if the smallest value and the first quartile were both one, the median and the third quartile were both five, and the largest value was seven, the box plot would look like the following:</p>

    <p>Box plots are a type of graph that can help visually organize data. Before a box plot can be graphed, the following data points must be calculated: the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. Once the box plot is graphed, you can display and compare distributions of data.</p>



  </section>

  <section xml:id="sec-measures-center">
    <title>Measures of the Center of the Data</title>
    <p>The <em>center</em> of a data set is also a way of describing location.
The two most widely used measures of the <em>center</em> of the data are the <term>mean</term> (average) and the <term>median</term>. To calculate the <em>mean weight</em> of 50 people, add the 50 weights together and divide by 50. To find the <em> median weight</em> of the 50 people, order the data and find the number that splits the data into two equal parts. The median is generally a better measure of the center when there are extreme values or outliers because it is not affected by the precise numerical values of the outliers. The mean is the most common measure of the center.</p>

    <note xml:id="eip-13">
      <title>NOTE</title>
      <p>The words <em>mean</em> and <em>average</em> are often used interchangeably. The substitution of one word for the other is common practice. The technical term is <em>arithmetic mean</em> and <em>average</em> is technically a center location. However, in practice among non statisticians, <em>average</em> is commonly accepted for <em>arithmetic mean</em>.</p>
    </note>

    <p>When each value in the data set is not unique, the mean can be calculated by multiplying each distinct value by its frequency and then dividing the sum by the total number of data values. The letter used to represent the <em>sample mean</em> is an <em>x</em> with a bar over it (pronounced “x bar”): <m>x</m>. The sample mean is a statistic.</p>

    <p>The Greek letter <em>μ</em> (pronounced "mew") represents the <em>population mean</em>. The population mean is a parameter. One of the requirements for the <em>sample mean</em> to be a good estimate of the <em>population mean</em> is for the sample taken to be truly random.</p>

    <p>To see that both ways of calculating the mean are the same, consider the following sample:

1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4</p>

    <p>In the second example, the frequencies are 3(1) + 2(2) + 1(3) + 5(4).</p>

    <p>You can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression <m>\frac{n+1}{2}</m>.</p>

    <p>The letter <em>n</em> is the total number of data values in the sample. As discussed earlier, if <em>n</em> is an odd number, the median is the middle value of the ordered data (ordered smallest to largest). If <em>n</em> is an even number, the median is equal to the two middle values added together and divided by two after the data have been ordered. For example, if the total number of data values is 97, then <m>\frac{n+1}{2}</m>=
<m>\frac{97+1}{2}</m> = 49. The median is the 49<m>^{th}</m> value in the ordered data. If the total number of data values is 100, then <m>\frac{n+1}{2}</m>=
<m>\frac{100+1}{2}</m> = 50.5. The median occurs midway between the 50<m>^{th}</m> and 51<m>^{st}</m> values. The location of the median and the value of the median are <em>not</em> the same. The uppercase letter <em>M</em> is often used to represent the median. The next example illustrates the location of the median and the value of the median.</p>

        <p>In a sample of 60 households, one house is worth $2,500,000. Half of the rest are worth $280,000, and all the others are worth $315,000. Which is the better measure of the <em>center</em>: the mean or the median?</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>The median is the better measure of the “center” than the mean because 59 of the values are $280,000 and one is $2,500,000. The $2,500,000 is an outlier. Either $280,000 or $315,000 gives us a better sense of the middle of the data.</p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <p>Another measure of the center is the mode. The <term>mode</term> is the most frequent value. There can be more than one mode in a data set as long as those values have the same frequency and that frequency is the highest. A data set with two modes is called bimodal.</p>

See <em>Chapter 1: Sampling and Data</em> for a review of relative frequency. Suppose 30 randomly selected students were asked the number of movies they watched the previous week.

    <p><em>A relative frequency distribution includes the relative frequencies of a number of samples.</em></p>

    <p>Recall that a <em>statistic</em> is a number calculated from a sample. Statistic examples include the mean, the median, and the mode as well as others. The sample mean <m>\overline{x}</m> is an example of a statistic that estimates the population mean <em>μ</em>.</p>

    <p>When only grouped data is available, you do not know the individual data values (we know only intervals and interval frequencies); therefore, you cannot compute an exact mean for the data set. What we must do is estimate the actual mean by calculating the mean of a frequency table. A frequency table is a data representation in which grouped data is displayed along with the corresponding frequencies. To calculate the mean from a grouped frequency table, we can apply the basic definition of mean: <em>mean</em> = <m>\frac{data\text{ }sum}{number\text{ }of\text{ }data\text{ }values}\text{.}</m> We simply need to modify the definition to fit within the restrictions of a frequency table.</p>

    <p>Since we do not know the individual data values, we can instead find the midpoint of each interval. The midpoint is <m>\frac{lower\text{ }boundary+upper\text{ }boundary}{2}</m>. We can now modify the mean definition to be <m>Mean\text{ }of\text{ }Frequency\text{ }Table=\frac{
      \sum fm
     }{
      \sum f
     }\text{,}</m> where <em>f</em> = the frequency of the interval, <em>m</em> = the midpoint of the interval, and sigma (∑) is read as "sigma" and means to sum up. So this formula says that we will sum the products of each midpoint and the corresponding frequency and divide by the sum of all of the frequencies.</p>

    <p>The mean and the median can be calculated to help you find the <em>center</em> of a data set. The mean is the best estimate for the actual data set, but the median is the best measurement when a data set contains several outliers or extreme values. The mode will tell you the most frequently occurring datum (or data) in your data set. The mean, median, and mode are extremely helpful when you need to analyze your data, but if your data set consists of ranges that lack specific values, the mean may seem impossible to calculate. However, the mean can be approximated if you add the lower boundary with the upper boundary and divide by two to find the midpoint of each interval. Multiply each midpoint by the number of values found in the corresponding range. Divide the sum of these values by the total number of data values in the set.</p>

4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10</p>

    <p>This data set can be represented by the following histogram. Each interval has width 1, and each value is located in the middle of an interval.</p>

    <figure xml:id="M06_Ch02_fig001">
      <image source="media/fig-ch02_08_01.jpg" width="80%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>The histogram displays a <em>symmetrical</em> distribution of data. A distribution is symmetrical if a vertical line can be drawn at some point in the histogram such that the shape to the left and the right of the vertical line are mirror images of each other. The mean, the median, and the mode are each seven for these data. <em>In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the mean and the median are the same.</em> This example has one mode (unimodal), and the mode is the same as the mean and median. In a symmetrical distribution that has two modes (bimodal), the two modes would be different from the mean and median.</p>

    <p>The histogram for the data: 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8 is not symmetrical. The right-hand side seems <em>chopped off</em> compared to the left-hand side. A distribution of this type is called <em>skewed to the left</em> because it is pulled out to the left. A skewed left distribution has more high values.</p>

    <figure xml:id="M06_Ch02_fig002">
      <image source="media/fig-ch02_08_02.jpg" width="80%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>The mean is 6.3, the median is 6.5, and the mode is seven. <em>Notice that the mean is less than the median, and they are both less than the mode</em>. The mean and the median both reflect the skewing, but the mean reflects it more so. The mean is pulled toward the tail in a skewed distribution.</p>

    <p>The histogram for the data: 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10 is also not symmetrical. It is <em>skewed to the right</em>. A skewed right distribution has more low values.</p>

    <figure xml:id="M06_Ch02_fig003">
      <image source="media/fig-ch02_08_03.jpg" width="80%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>The mean is 7.7, the median is 7.5, and the mode is seven. Of the three statistics, <em>the mean is the largest, while the mode is the smallest</em>. Again, the mean reflects the skewing the most.</p>

    <p>To summarize, generally if the distribution of data is skewed to the left, the mean is less than the median, which is often less than the mode. If the distribution of data is skewed to the right, the mode is often less than the median, which is less than the mean.</p>

    <p>Skewness and symmetry become important when we discuss probability distributions in later chapters. </p>

    <title>Measures of the Spread of the Data</title>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-the-standard-deviation">
      <title>The standard deviation</title>

    <p>An important characteristic of any set of data is the variation in the data. In some data sets, the data values are concentrated closely near the mean; in other data sets, the data values are more widely spread out from the mean. The most common measure of variation, or spread, is the standard deviation. The <term>standard deviation</term> is a number that measures how far data values are from their mean.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>provides a numerical measure of the overall amount of variation in a data set and</p></li>
      <li><p>can be used to determine whether a particular data value is close to or far from the mean.</p></li>
    </ul>

    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-std-dev-variation">
      <title>The standard deviation provides a measure of the overall variation in a data set.</title>

    <p>The standard deviation is always positive or zero. The standard deviation is small when all the data are concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little variation or spread. The standard deviation is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more variation.</p>

    <p>Suppose that we are studying the amount of time customers wait in line at the checkout at Supermarket A and Supermarket B. The average wait time at both supermarkets is five minutes. At Supermarket A, the standard deviation for the wait time is two minutes; at Supermarket B, the standard deviation for the wait time is four minutes.</p>

    <p>Because Supermarket B has a higher standard deviation, we know that there is more variation in the wait times at Supermarket B. Overall, wait times at Supermarket B are more spread out from the average whereas wait times at  Supermarket A are more concentrated near the average.</p>


    <p>Suppose that both Rosa and Binh shop at Supermarket A. Rosa waits at the checkout counter for seven minutes, and Binh waits for one minute. At Supermarket A, the mean waiting time is five minutes, and the standard deviation is two minutes. The standard deviation can be used to determine whether a data value is close to or far from the mean. A <em>z</em>-score is a standardized score that lets us compare data sets. It tells us how many standard deviations a data value is from the mean and is calculated as the ratio of the difference in a particular score and the population mean to the population standard deviation.</p>

    <p>We can use the given information to create the table below.</p>

    <table>
      <tabular>
        <row header="yes">
          <cell>Supermarket</cell>
          <cell>Population Standard Deviation, <em>σ</em></cell>
          <cell>Individual Score, <em>x</em></cell>

          <cell></cell>
          <cell>5</cell>
        </row>
      </tabular>
    </table>

    <p>Since Rosa and Binh only shop at Supermarket A, we can ignore the row for Supermarket B.</p>

    <p>We need the values from the first row to determine the number of standard deviations above or below the mean each individual wait time is; we can do so by calculating two different <em>z</em>-scores.</p>

    <p>Rosa waited for seven minutes, so the <em>z</em>-score representing this deviation from the population mean may be calculated as</p>

    <p>The <em>z</em>-score of one tells us that Rosa’s wait time is one standard deviation above the mean wait time of five minutes.</p>

    <p>Binh waited for one minute, so the <em>z</em>-score representing this deviation from the population mean may be calculated as</p>

    <p>The <em>z</em>-score of −2 tells us that Binh’s wait time is two standard deviations below the mean wait time of five minutes.</p>

    <p>A data value that is two standard deviations from the average is just on the borderline for what many statisticians would consider to be far from the average. Considering data to be far from the mean if they are more than two standard deviations away is more of an approximate <em>rule of thumb</em> than a rigid rule. In general, the shape of the distribution of the data affects how much of the data is farther away than two standard deviations. You will learn more about this in later chapters.</p>

    <p>The number line may help you understand standard deviation. If we were to put five and seven on a number line, seven is to the right of five. We say, then, that seven is <em>one</em> standard deviation to the <em>right</em> of five because 5 + (1)(2) = 7.</p>

    <p>If one were also part of the data set, then one is <em>two</em> standard deviations to the <em>left</em> of five because 5 + (–2)(2) = 1.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>In general, a <em>value = mean + (#ofSTDEV)(standard deviation)</em></p></li>

      <li><p>One is <em>two standard deviations less than the mean</em> of five because 1 = 5 + (–2)(2).</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The equation <em>value = mean + (#ofSTDEVs)(standard deviation)</em> can be expressed for a sample and for a population as follows:
<em>Sample:</em>  <m>x\text{ = }\overline{x}\text{ + }(#ofSTDEV)(s)</m>
<em>Population:</em>  <m>x=μ+(#ofSTDEV)(σ)\text{.}</m>


The lowercase letter <em>s</em> represents the sample standard deviation and the Greek letter <em>σ</em> (lower case) represents the population standard deviation.




The symbol <m>
  
  x
</m> is the sample mean, and the Greek symbol
<m>μ</m> is the population mean.</p>


      <p>If <em>x</em> is a number, then the difference <em>x – mean</em> is called its <em>deviation</em>. In a data set, there are as many deviations as there are items in the data set. The deviations are used to calculate the standard deviation. If the numbers belong to a population, in symbols, a deviation is <em>x</em> – <em>μ</em>. For sample data, in symbols, a deviation is <em>x</em> – <m>\overline{x}</m>.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-calculating-standard-deviation">
      <title>Calculating the Standard Deviation</title>

    <p>The procedure to calculate the standard deviation depends on whether the numbers are the entire population or are data from a sample. The calculations are similar but not identical. Therefore, the symbol used to represent the standard deviation depends on whether it is calculated from a population or a sample. The lowercase letter <em>s</em> represents the sample standard deviation and the Greek letter <em>σ</em> (lowercase sigma) represents the population standard deviation. If the sample has the same characteristics as the population, then <em>s</em> should be a good estimate of <em>σ</em>.</p>

    <p>To calculate the standard deviation, we need to calculate the variance first. The <term>variance</term> is the <em>average of the squares of the deviations</em> (the <em>x</em> – <m>\overline{x}</m> values for a sample or the <em>x</em> – <em>μ</em> values for a population). The symbol <em>σ</em><m>^{2}</m> represents the population variance; the population standard deviation <em>σ</em> is the square root of the population variance. The symbol <em>s</em><m>^{2}</m> represents the sample variance; the sample standard deviation <em>s</em> is the square root of the sample variance. You can think of the standard deviation as a special average of the deviations.</p>

    <p>If the numbers come from a census of the entire <em>population</em> and not a sample, when we calculate the average of the squared deviations to find the variance, we divide by <em>N</em>, the number of items in the population. If the data are from a <em>sample</em> rather than a population, when we calculate the average of the squared deviations, we divide by <em><em>n</em> – 1</em>, one less than the number of items in the sample.</p>


    <ul>
      <li><p> <m>s=\sqrt{\frac{Σ(x−\overline{x})^{2}}{n−1}}</m> or <m>s=\sqrt{\frac{Σf(x−\overline{x})^{2}}{n−1}}</m>
    </p></li>
      <li><p> For the sample standard deviation, the denominator is <em><em>n</em>−</em>; that is, the sample size <em>minus</em> 1.</p></li>
    </ul>


    <ul>
      <li><p>
<m>σ = \sqrt{\frac{Σ(x−μ)^{2}}{N}}</m> or <m>σ = \sqrt{\frac{Σf(x–μ)^{2}}{N}}</m></p></li>
      <li><p>For the population standard deviation, the denominator is <em>N</em>, the number of items in the population.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In these formulas, <em>f</em> represents the frequency with which a value appears. For example, if a value appears once, <em>f</em> is one. If a value appears three times in the data set or population, <em>f</em> is three.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-types-of-variability">
      <title>Types of Variability in Samples</title>

    <p>When researchers study a population, they often use a sample, either for convenience or because it is not possible to access the entire population. <em>Variability</em> is the term used to describe the differences that may occur in these outcomes. Common types of variability include the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Observational or measurement variability</p></li>
      <li><p>Natural variability</p></li>
      <li><p>Induced variability</p></li>
      <li><p>Sample variability</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are some examples to describe each type of variability:</p>

    <p>Example 1: Measurement variability</p>

    <p>Measurement variability occurs when there are differences in the instruments used to measure or in the people using those instruments. If we are gathering data on how long it takes for a ball to drop from a height by having students measure the time of the drop with a stopwatch, we may experience measurement variability if the two stopwatches used were made by different manufacturers. For example, one stopwatch measures to the nearest second, whereas the other one measures to the nearest tenth of a second. We also may experience measurement variability because two different people are gathering the data. Their reaction times in pressing the button on the stopwatch may differ; thus, the outcomes will vary accordingly. The differences in outcomes may be affected by measurement variability.</p>

    <p>Example 2: Natural variability</p>

    <p>Natural variability arises from the differences that naturally occur because members of a population differ from each other. For example, if we have two identical corn plants and we expose both plants to the same amount of water and sunlight, they may still grow at different rates simply because they are two different corn plants. The difference in outcomes may be explained by natural variability.</p>

    <p>Example 3: Induced variability</p>

    <p>Induced variability is the counterpart to natural variability. This occurs because we have artificially induced an element of variation that, by definition, was not present naturally. For example, we assign people to two different groups to study memory, and we induce a variable in one group by limiting the amount of sleep they get. The difference in outcomes may be affected by induced variability.</p>

    <p>Example 4: Sample variability</p>

    <p>Sample variability occurs when multiple random samples are taken from the same population. For example, if I conduct four surveys of 50 people randomly selected from a given population, the differences in outcomes may be affected by sample variability.</p>

    <p>The statistic of a sampling distribution was discussed in <xref ref="ch02-descriptive-statistics">Descriptive Statistics: Measures of the Center of the Data</xref>. How much the statistic varies from one sample to another is known as the  <term>sampling variability of a statistic</term>. You typically measure the sampling variability of a statistic by its standard error. The <em>standard error of the mean</em> is an example of a standard error. The standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. In other words, it is the average standard deviation that results from repeated sampling. You will cover the standard error of the mean in the chapter <xref ref="ch07-central-limit-theorem">The Central Limit Theorem</xref> (not now). The notation for the standard error of the mean is <m>\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}}</m>, where <em>σ</em> is the standard deviation of the population and <em>n</em> is the size of the sample.</p>

    </subsection>

    <note xml:id="id7166567">
      <title>NOTE</title>
      <p><em>In practice, use a calculator or computer software to calculate the standard deviation. If you are using a TI-83, 83+, or 84+ calculator, you need to select the appropriate standard deviation <em>σ<m>_{x}</m></em> or <em>s<m>_{x}</m></em> from the summary statistics.</em> We will concentrate on using and interpreting the information that the standard deviation gives us. However, you should study the following step-by-step example to help you understand how the standard deviation measures variation from the mean. The calculator instructions appear at the end of this example.</p>

      <statement>
        <p>On a baseball team, the ages of each of the players are as follows:</p>
        <p>21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 24, 25, 25, 28, 29, 29, 31, 32, 33, 33, 34, 35, 36, 36, 36, 36, 38, 38, 38, 40
</p>
        <p>
Use your calculator or computer to find the mean and standard deviation. Then find the value that is two standard deviations above the mean.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p><em>μ</em> = 30.68</p>
        <p><em>s</em> = 6.09

(<m>\overline{x}</m> + 2<em>s</em>) = 30.68 + (2)(6.09) = 42.86.</p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <p>The deviations show how spread out the data are about the mean. The data value 11.5 is farther from the mean than is the data value 11, which is indicated by the deviations .97 and .47. A positive deviation occurs when the data value is greater than the mean, whereas a negative deviation occurs when the data value is less than the mean. The deviation is –1.525 for the data value nine. <em>If you add the deviations, the sum is always zero</em>. We can sum the products of the frequencies and deviations to show that the sum of the deviations is always zero. <m>1(−1.525)+2(−1.025)+4(−.525)+4(−.025)+6(.475)+3(.975)=0</m> For , there are <em>n</em> = 20 deviations. So you cannot simply add the deviations to get the spread of the data. By squaring the deviations, you make them positive numbers, and the sum will also be positive. The variance, then, is the average squared deviation.</p>

    <p>The variance is a squared measure and does not have the same units as the data. Taking the square root solves the problem. The standard deviation measures the spread in the same units as the data.</p>

    <p>Notice that instead of dividing by <em>n</em> = 20, the calculation divided by <em>n</em> – 1 = 20 – 1 = 19 because the data is a sample. For the <em>sample</em> variance, we divide by the sample size minus one (<em>n</em> – 1). Why not divide by <em>n</em>?  The answer has to do with the population variance. <em>The sample variance is an estimate of the population variance.</em> Based on the theoretical mathematics that lies behind these calculations, dividing by (<em>n</em> – 1) gives a better estimate of the population variance.</p>

    <note xml:id="eip-718">
      <title>NOTE</title>
      <p>Your concentration should be on what the standard deviation tells us about the data. The standard deviation is a number that measures how far the data are spread from the mean. Let a calculator or computer do the arithmetic.</p>
    </note>

    <p>The standard deviation, <em>s</em> or <em>σ</em>, is either zero or larger than zero. Describing the data with reference to the spread is called <em>variability</em>. The variability in data depends on the method by which the outcomes are obtained, for example, by measuring or by random sampling. When the standard deviation is zero, there is no spread; that is, all the data values are equal to each other. The standard deviation is small when all the data are concentrated close to the mean and larger when the data values show more variation from the mean. When the standard deviation is a lot larger than zero, the data values are very spread out about the mean; outliers can make <em>s</em> or <em>σ</em> very large.</p>

    <p>The standard deviation, when first presented, can seem unclear. By graphing your data, you can get a better <em>feel</em> for the deviations and the standard deviation. You will find that in symmetrical distributions, the standard deviation can be very helpful, but in skewed distributions, the standard deviation may not be much help. The reason is that the two sides of a skewed distribution have different spreads. In a skewed distribution, it is better to look at the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, the smallest value, and the largest value. Because numbers can be confusing, <em>always graph your data</em>. Display your data in a histogram or a box plot.</p>

    <p>Recall that for grouped data we do not know individual data values, so we cannot describe the typical value of the data with precision. In other words, we cannot find the exact mean, median, or mode. We can, however, determine the best estimate of the measures of center by finding the mean of the grouped data with the formula <m>Mean\text{ }of\text{ }Frequency\text{ }Table=\frac{
      \sum fm}{
      \sum f
     }\text{,}</m>


where <m>f=</m> interval frequencies and <em>m</em> = interval midpoints.</p>

    <p>Just as we could not find the exact mean, neither can we find the exact standard deviation. Remember that standard deviation describes numerically the expected deviation a data value has from the mean. In simple English, the standard deviation allows us to compare how <em>unusual</em> individual data are when compared to the mean.</p>

      <p>For this data set, we have the mean, <m>\overline{x}</m> = 7.58, and the standard deviation, <em>s<m>_{x}</m></em> = 3.5. This means that a randomly selected data value would be expected to be 3.5 units from the mean. If we look at the first class, we see that the class midpoint is equal to one. This is almost two full standard deviations from the mean since 7.58 – 3.5 – 3.5 = .58. While the formula for calculating the standard deviation is not complicated, <m>s_{x}=\sqrt{\frac{f(m−\overline{x})^{2}}{n−1}}\text{,}</m> where <em>s<m>_{x}</m></em> = sample standard deviation, <m>\overline{x}</m> = sample mean; the calculations are tedious. It is usually best to use technology when performing the calculations.</p>

    <p>As explained before, a <em>z</em>-score allows us to compare statistics from different data sets. If the data sets have different means and standard deviations, then comparing the data values directly can be misleading.</p>

      <li><p>In symbols, the formulas for calculating <em>z</em>-scores become the following.

    <p>The following lists give a few facts that provide a little more insight into what the standard deviation tells us about the distribution of the data.</p>

    <p><em>For </em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>At least 75 percent of the data is within two standard deviations of the mean.</p></li>
      <li><p>At least 89 percent of the data is within three standard deviations of the mean.</p></li>
      <li><p>At least 95 percent of the data is within 4.5 standard deviations of the mean.</p></li>
      <li><p>This is known as Chebyshev's Rule.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>A bell-shaped distribution is one that is normal and symmetric, meaning the curve can be folded along a line of symmetry drawn through the median, and the left and right sides of the curve would fold on each other symmetrically.. With a bell-shaped distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all located at the same place.</p>

    <p><em>For data having a distribution that is </em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Approximately 68 percent of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean.</p></li>
      <li><p>Approximately 95 percent of the data is within two standard deviations of the mean.</p></li>
      <li><p>More than 99 percent of the data is within three standard deviations of the mean.</p></li>
      <li><p>This is known as the Empirical Rule.</p></li>
      <li><p>It is important to note that this rule applies only when the shape of the distribution of the data is bell-shaped and symmetric; we will learn more about this when studying the <em>Normal</em> or <em>Gaussian</em> probability distribution in later chapters.</p></li>

    <p>The standard deviation can help you calculate the spread of data. There are different equations to use if you are calculating the standard deviation of a sample or of a population. </p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The standard deviation allows us to compare individual data or classes to the data set mean numerically.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>s</em> = <m>\sqrt{\frac{\sum^{\text{​}}(x−\overline{x})^{2}}{n−1}}</m> or <em>s</em> = <m>\sqrt{\frac{\sum^{\text{​}}f(x−\overline{x})^{2}}{n−1}}</m> is the formula for calculating the standard deviation of a sample. To calculate the standard deviation of a population, we would use the population mean, <em>μ</em>, and the formula <em>σ</em> = <m>\sqrt{\frac{\sum^{\text{​}}(x−μ)^{2}}{N}}</m> or <em>σ</em> = <m>\sqrt{\frac{\sum^{\text{​}}f(x−μ)^{2}}{N}}</m>.</p></li>

        <p>Often, cruise ships conduct all onboard transactions, with the exception of souvenirs, on a cashless basis. At the end of the cruise, guests pay one bill that covers all onboard transactions. Suppose that 60 single travelers and 70 couples were surveyed as to their onboard bills for a seven-day cruise from Los Angeles to the Mexican Riviera. Following is a summary of the bills for each group:</p>

      The couples graph has a class interval with no values
      It takes almost twice as many class intervals to display the data for couples

          <li><p>Answers may vary. Possible answers include the following. You are able to compare the graphs interval by interval. It is easier to compare the overall patterns with the new scale on the couples graph. Because a couple represents two individuals, the new scale leads to a more accurate comparison.</p></li>
          <li><p>Answers may vary. Possible answers include the following. Based on the histograms, it seems that spending does not vary much from singles to individuals who are part of a couple.

        <p>The median age for U.S. ethnicity A currently is 30.9 years; for U.S. ethnicity B, it is 42.3 years.

Based on this information, give two reasons why ethnicity A median age could be lower than the ethnicity B median age.
Does the lower median age for ethnicity A necessarily mean that ethnicity A die younger than ethnicity B? Why or why not?
How might it be possible for ethnicity A and ethnicity B to die at approximately the same age but for the median age for ethnicity B to be higher?

    <title>Chapter Review</title>
    
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-display-data-review">
      <title>Displaying Data</title>
      <p>A stem plot is a quick way to make a sketch of a distribution while showing every individual value in the dataset. Stem plots are especially useful for small to moderate sized data sets. They allow you to see the shape of the distribution and identify outliers. To create a stem plot, each observation is separated into a stem, such as the leftmost digit(s), and a leaf, such as the rightmost digit.</p>
      <p>A frequency polygon is useful when comparing multiple distributions. It uses points connected by straight lines to depict the frequency of values in a data set.</p>
      <p>A time series graph is a graph that presents data chronologically. It can be useful in detecting trends over time.</p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-measures-location-review">
      <title>Measures of the Location of the Data</title>
      <p>The values that divide a rank-ordered set of data into 100 equal parts are called percentiles. Percentiles are useful for comparing values. For each data value, it's percentile is the percent of values that are less than or equal to that value. The median is the 50th percentile.</p>
      <p>Quartiles are numbers that separate the data into quarters. Quartiles may or may not be part of the data. The second quartile, Q₂, is the median of the data. Q₁ is the value so that 25% of the data are less than or equal to Q₁, and Q₃ is the value so that 75% of the data are less than or equal to Q₃.</p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-box-plots-review">
      <title>Box Plots</title>
      <p>Box plots are a type of graph that can help visually organize data. To graph a box plot the following data points must be calculated: the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. Once the box plot is graphed, you can display and compare distributions of data.</p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-measures-center-review">
      <title>Measures of the Center of the Data</title>
      <p>The mean, median, and mode are measures of the center of a data set. The mean is the arithmetic average. Add all the data values and divide by the number of values in the data set to get the mean. The median is the middle value when the data are ordered. If there is an even number of data values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The mode is the data value (or values) that occurs most frequently.</p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-skewness-review">
      <title>Skewness and the Mean, Median, and Mode</title>
      <p>Looking at the distribution of data can reveal a lot about the relationship between the mean, the median, and the mode. There are three types of distributions. A right (or positively) skewed distribution has a shape with a long tail to the right. A left (or negatively) skewed distribution has a shape with a long tail to the left. A symmetrical distribution has equal proportions on both sides of the center.</p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-measures-spread-review">
      <title>Measures of the Spread of the Data</title>
      <p>Measures of the spread of the data describe how the data are distributed. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Another measure of spread is the variance. The variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. The standard deviation is the positive square root of the variance and has the same units as the data.</p>
      <p>The interquartile range, IQR, is the range of the middle 50 percent of the data values. The IQR is found by subtracting Q₁ from Q₃, and can help determine outliers by using the following two expressions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Q₁ – 1.5(IQR)</p></li>
        <li><p>Q₃ + 1.5(IQR)</p></li>
      </ul>
