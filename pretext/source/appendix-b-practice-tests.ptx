      <em>Use the following information to answer the next three exercises.</em> A community college offers classes six days a week: Monday through Saturday. Maria conducted a study of the students in her classes to determine how many days per week the students who are in her classes come to campus for classes. In each of her five classes she randomly selected 10 students and asked them how many days they come to campus for classes.

Each of her classes are the same size.

The results of her survey are summarized in  . Number of Days on Campus

This term, a class of 49 students had a standard deviation of 5 on the midterm. Do the data indicate that we should reject the teacher’s claim that the standard deviation is 5.2?
