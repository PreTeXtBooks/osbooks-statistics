Two researchers studying vaccination rates independently draw samples of 50 children, aged three–18 months, from a large urban area, and determine if they are up to date on their vaccinations. One researcher finds that 84 percent of the children in her sample are up to date, and the other finds that 86 percent in his sample are up to date.

        <em>18</em> . A high school increased the length of the school day from 6.5 to 7.5 hours. Students who wished to attend this high school were required to sign contracts pledging to put forth their best effort on their school work and to obey the school rules; if they did not wish to do so, they could attend another high school in the district. At the end of one year, student performance on statewide tests had increased by 10 percentage points over the previous year. Does this prove that a longer school day improves student achievement?

        <em>12</em> . Answers will vary. 
 Sample Answer: One possibility is to obtain the class roster and assign each student a number from 1 to 200. Then, use a random number generator or table of random number to generate 30 numbers between 1 and 200, and select the students matching the random numbers. It would also be acceptable to write each student’s name on a card, shuffle them in a box, and draw 30 names at random.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>13</em> . One possibility would be to obtain a roster of students enrolled in the college, including the class standing for each student. Then, you would draw a proportionate random sample from within each class. For instance, if 30 percent of the students in the college are freshman, then 30 percent of your sample would be drawn from the freshman class.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>14</em> . For the first person picked, the chance of any individual being selected is one in 150. For the second person, it is one in 149, for the third it is one in 148, and so on. For the 30th person selected, the chance of selection is one in 121.

        <em>15. A</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>16</em> . No. There are at least two chances for bias. First, the viewers of this particular program may not be representative of American football fans as a whole. Second, the sample will be self-selected, because people have to make a phone call in order to take part, and those people are probably not representative of the American football fan population as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>17</em> . These results (84 percent in one sample, 86 percent in the other) are probably due to sampling variability. Each researcher drew a different sample of children, and you would not expect them to get exactly the same result, although you would expect the results to be similar, as they are in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>18</em> . No. The improvement could also be due to self-selection: Only motivated students were willing to sign the contract, and they would have done well even in a school with 6.5 hour days. Because both changes were implemented at the same time, it is not possible to separate out their influence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>19</em> . At least two aspects of this poll are troublesome. The first is that it was conducted by a group who would benefit by the result—almond sales are likely to increase if people believe that eating almonds will make them happier. The second is that this poll found that almond consumption and life satisfaction are correlated, but it does not establish that eating almonds causes satisfaction. It is equally possible, for instance, that people with higher incomes are more likely to eat almonds and are also more satisfied with their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>20</em> . You want the sample of people who take part in a survey to be representative of the population from which they are drawn. People who refuse to take part in a survey often have different views than those who do participate, and so even a random sample may produce biased results if a large percentage of those selected refuse to participate in a survey.

        <em>23</em> . There are many lurking variables that could influence the observed differences in test scores. Perhaps the boys, on average, have taken more math courses than the girls, and the girls have taken more English classes than the boys. Perhaps the boys have been encouraged by their families and teachers to prepare for a career in math and science, and thus have put more effort into studying math, while the girls have been encouraged to prepare for fields like communication and psychology that are more focused on language use. A study design would have to control for these and other potential lurking variables (anything that could explain the observed difference in test scores, other than the genetic explanation) in order to draw a scientifically sound conclusion about genetic differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>24</em> . To use random assignment, you would have to be able to assign people to either exercise or not exercise. Because exercise has many beneficial effects, this would not be an ethical experiment. We will study people who chose to exercise and compare them to people who chose not to exercise, and try to control for the other ways those two groups may differ (lurking variables).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>25</em> . Sources of bias include the fact that not everyone has a telephone, that cell phone numbers are often not listed in published directories, and that an individual might not be at home at the time of the phone call; all these factors make it likely that the respondents to the survey will not be representative of the population as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>26</em> . Research subjects should not be coerced into participation, and offering extra credit in exchange for participation could be construed as coercion. In addition, this method will result in a volunteer sample, which cannot be assumed to be representative of the population as a whole.

Each sample appears to have been drawn from normally distributed populations, the factor is a categorical variable (method), the outcome is a numerical variable (test score), and you were told the samples were independent and randomly selected, so those requirements are met. However, each sample has a different standard deviation, and this suggests that the populations from which they were drawn also have different standard deviations, which is a violation of an assumption for one-way ANOVA. Further statistical testing will be necessary to test the assumption of equal variance before proceeding with the analysis.

      <em>Use the following information to answer the next three exercises.</em> A community college offers classes six days a week: Monday through Saturday. Maria conducted a study of the students in her classes to determine how many days per week the students who are in her classes come to campus for classes. In each of her five classes she randomly selected 10 students and asked them how many days they come to campus for classes.

Each of her classes are the same size.

The results of her survey are summarized in the table below . Number of Days on Campus

      <em>27</em> . From past experience, a statistics teacher has found that the average score on a midterm is 81, with a standard deviation of 5.2. This term, a class of 49 students had a standard deviation of 5 on the midterm. Do the data indicate that we should reject the teacher’s claim that the standard deviation is 5.2? Use <em>α</em> = 0.05.

      <em>28</em> . Three loading machines are being compared. Ten samples were taken for each machine. Machine I took an average of 31 minutes to load packages, with a standard deviation of two minutes. Machine II took an average of 28 minutes to load packages, with a standard deviation of 1.5 minutes. Machine III took an average of 29 minutes to load packages, with a standard deviation of one minute. Find the <em>p</em> -value when testing that the average loading times are the same.
