      <title>Chapter Objectives</title>
      <p>By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognize and understand discrete probability distribution functions, in general.</li>
        <li>Calculate and interpret expected values.</li>
        <li>Recognize the binomial probability distribution and apply it appropriately.</li>
        <li>Recognize the poisson probability distribution and apply it appropriately.</li>
        <li>Recognize the geometric probability distribution and apply it appropriately.</li>
        <li>Recognize the hypergeometric probability distribution and apply it appropriately.</li>
        <li>Classify discrete word problems by their distributions.</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>

    <p>A student takes a 10-question, true-false quiz. Because the student had such a busy schedule, he or she could not study and guesses randomly at each answer. What is the probability of the student passing the test with at least a 70 percent?</p>
    
    <p>Small companies might be interested in the number of long-distance phone calls their employees make during the peak time of the day. Suppose the average is 20 calls. What is the probability that the employees make more than 20 long-distance phone calls during the peak time?</p>

    <p>These two examples illustrate two different types of probability problems involving discrete random variables. Recall that discrete data are data that you can count. A random variable is a variable whose values are numerical outcome of a probability experiment. We always describe a random variable in words and its values in numbers. The values of a random variable can vary with each repetition of an experiment.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="randvarnot">
      <title>Random Variable Notation</title>
      <p>Uppercase letters such as <em>X</em> or <em>Y</em> denote a random variable. Lowercase letters like <em>x</em> or <em>y</em> denote the value of a random variable. If <alert><em>X</em> is a random variable, then <em>X</em> is written in words, and <em>x</em> is given as a number.</alert></p>

      <p>The following are examples of random variables:</p>

      <p>Example 1: Suppose a jar contains three marbles, one blue, one red, and one white. Randomly draw one marble from the jar. Let <em>X</em> = the possible number of red marbles to be drawn. The sample space for the drawing is red, white, and blue. Then, <em>x</em> = 0,1. If the marble we draw is red, then <em>x</em> = 1; otherwise, <em>x</em> = 0.</p>

      <p>Example 2: Let <em>X</em> = the number of female children in a randomly selected family with only two kids. Here we are only interested in families with two kids, not families with one kid or more than two kids. The sample space for the genders of two-kid families is <em>MM, MF, FM, FF</em>. Here the first letter represents the gender of the older child and the second letter represents the gender of the younger child. F represents a female child and M represents a male child. For example, FM represents that the older child is a girl and the younger child is a boy, while MF represents that the older child is a boy and the younger child is a girl. Then, <em>x</em> = 0,1,2. A family has 0 female children if it has two boys (MM), a family has one female child if it has one boy and one girl (MF or FM), and a family has two female children if both kids are girls (FF).</p>

      <p>Example 3: Let <em>X</em> = the number of heads you get when you toss three fair coins. The sample space for the toss of three fair coins is <em>TTT, THH, HTH, HHT, HTT, THT, TTH, HHH</em>. Here the first letter represents the result of the first toss, the second letter represents the result of the second toss, and the third letter represents the result of the third toss. T represents a tail and H represents a head. For example, THH means we get a tail in the first toss but a head in the second and third toss, while HHT means we get a head in the first and second toss but a tail in the third toss. Then, <em>x</em> = 0, 1, 2, 3. There are 0 heads if the result is TTT, one head if the result is THT, TTH, or HTT, two heads if the result is THH, HTH, or HHT, and three heads if the result is HHH.</p>

  <section xml:id="sec-probability-distribution-function">
    <title>Probability Distribution Function (PDF) for a Discrete Random Variable</title>
    
    <p>There are two types of <term xml:id="term-ch04-random-variables">random variables</term>, discrete random variables and continuous random variables. The values of a <em>discrete random variable</em> are countable, which means the values are obtained by counting. All random variables we discussed in previous examples are discrete random variables. We counted the number of red balls, the number of heads, or the number of female children to get the corresponding random variable values. The values of a <em>continuous random variable</em> are uncountable, which means the values are not obtained by counting. Instead, they are obtained by measuring. For example, let <em>X</em> = temperature of a randomly selected day in June in a city. The value of <em>X</em> can be 68°, 71.5°, 80.6°, or 90.32°. These values are obtained by measuring by a thermometer. Another example of a continuous random variable is the height of a randomly selected high school student. The value of this random variable can be 5'2", 6'1", or 5'8". Those values are obtained by measuring by a ruler.</p>

    <p>A discrete <term xml:id="term-ch04-probability-distribution-function">probability distribution function</term> has two characteristics:</p>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Each probability is between zero and one, inclusive.</li>
        <li>The sum of the probabilities is one.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-ch04-pdf-1">
      <p>A child psychologist is interested in the number of times a newborn baby's crying wakes its mother after midnight. For a random sample of 50 mothers, the following information was obtained. Let <em>X</em> = the number of times per week a newborn baby's crying wakes its mother after midnight. For this example, <em>x</em> = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>

      <p><em>P</em>(<em>x</em>) = probability that <em>X</em> takes on a value <em>x</em>.</p>

      <p><em>X</em> takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This is a discrete PDF because we can count the number of values of <em>x</em> and also because of the following two reasons:</p>

      <p>
        <ol marker="a">
          <li>Each <em>P</em>(<em>x</em>) is between zero and one, therefore inclusive</li>
          <li>The sum of the probabilities is one, that is,</li>

      As you learned in 
      <xref ref="ch03-probability-topics">Chapter 3</xref>
      , if you toss a fair coin, the probability that the result is heads is 0.5. This probability is a theoretical probability, which is what we expect to happen. This probability does not describe the short-term results of an experiment. If you flip a coin two times, the probability does not tell you that these flips will result in one head and one tail. Even if you flip a coin 10 times or 100 times, the probability does not tell you that you will get half tails and half heads. The probability gives information about what can be expected in the long term. To demonstrate this, Karl Pearson once tossed a fair coin 24,000 times! He recorded the results of each toss, obtaining heads 12,012 times. The relative frequency of heads is 12,012/24,000 = .5005, which is very close to the theoretical probability .5. In his experiment, Pearson illustrated the law of large numbers.

    <example xml:id="element-116">
      <p xml:id="element-117">
        Suppose you play a game of chance in which five numbers are chosen from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. A computer randomly selects five numbers from zero to nine with replacement. You pay $2 to play and could profit $100,000 if you match all five numbers in order (you get your $2 back plus $100,000). Over the long term, what is your 
        <em>expected</em>
         profit of playing the game?
      </p>
      <p xml:id="fs-id1164564484850">To do this problem, set up a PDF table for the amount of money you can profit.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-id1164567242944">
        Let 
        <em>X</em>
         = the amount of money you profit. If your five numbers match in order, you will win the game and will get your $2 back plus $100,000. That means your profit is $100,000. If your five numbers do not match in order, you will lose the game and lose your $2. That means your profit is -$2. Therefore, X takes on the values $100,000 and –$2. That is the second column 
        <em>x</em>
         in the PDF table below.
      </p>
      <p xml:id="fs-id1164567272570">
        To win, you must get all five numbers correct, in order. The probability of choosing the correct first number is 
        <m>\frac{1}{10}</m>
        
 because there are 10 numbers (from zero to nine) and only one of them is correct. The probability of choosing the correct second number is also 
        <m>\frac{1}{10}</m>
        
 because the selection is done with replacement and there are still 10 numbers (from zero to nine) for you to choose. Due to the same reason, the probability of choosing the correct third number, the correct fourth number, and the correct fifth number are also 
        <m>\frac{1}{10}</m>
        
. The selection of one number does not affect the selection of another number. That means the five selections are independent. The probability of choosing all five correct numbers and in order is equal to the product of the probabilities of choosing each number correctly. 
      </p>
      <me>\begin{matrix} \text{P}(\text{choosing all five numbers correctly})•\text{P}(\text{choosing 1st number correctly})• \\ \text{ P}(\text{choosing 2nd number correctly})•\text{ P}(\text{choosing 5th number correctly}) \\ =(\frac{1}{10})•(\frac{1}{10})•(\frac{1}{10})•(\frac{1}{10})•(\frac{1}{10}) \\ =.00001 \end{matrix}</me>
      <p xml:id="fs-id1164564477521">
        Therefore, the probability of winning is .00001 and the probability of losing is 1 − .00001 = .99999. That is how we get the third column 
        <em>P</em>
        (

  <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164966556607">
    <p>
      There are three characteristics of a <term xml:id="term-binomial-experiment">binomial experiment</term>:
    </p>
    <ol marker="1.">
      <li>
        <p>There are a fixed number of trials. Think of trials as repetitions of an experiment. The letter <em>n</em> denotes the number of trials.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There are only two possible outcomes, called <em>success</em> and <em>failure</em>, for each trial. The outcome that we are measuring is defined as a <em>success</em>, while the other outcome is defined as a <em>failure</em>. The letter <em>p</em> denotes the probability of a success on one trial, and <em>q</em> denotes the probability of a failure on one trial. <em>p</em> + <em>q</em> = 1.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <em>n</em> trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions. Because the <em>n</em> trials are independent, the outcome of one trial does not help in predicting the outcome of another trial. Another way of saying this is that for each individual trial, the probability, <em>p</em>, of a success and probability, <em>q</em>, of a failure remain the same. Let us look at several examples of a binomial experiment.</p>
        <p>Example 1: Toss a fair coin once and record the result.</p>
        <p>This is a binomial experiment since it meets all three characteristics. The number of trials <em>n</em> = 1. There are only two outcomes, a head or a tail, of each trial. We can define a head as a success if we are measuring number of heads. For a fair coin, the probabilities of getting head or tail are both .5. So, <em>p</em> = <em>q</em> − .5. Both <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> remain the same from trial to trial. This experiment is also called a <term xml:id="term-bernoulli-trial">Bernoulli trial</term>, named after Jacob Bernoulli who, in the late 1600s, studied such trials extensively. Any experiment that has characteristics two and three and where <em>n</em> = 1 is called a <term xml:id="term-bernoulli-trial">Bernoulli trial</term>. A binomial experiment takes place when the number of successes is counted in one or more Bernoulli trials.</p>
        <p>Example 2: Randomly guess a multiple choice question has A, B, C and D four options.</p>
        <p>This is a binomial experiment since it meets all three characteristics. The number of trials <em>n</em> = 1. There are only two outcomes, guess correctly or guess wrong, of each trial. We can define guess correctly as a success. For a random guess (you have no clue at all), the probability of guessing correct should be <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> because there are four options and only one option is correct. So,  and <m>p=\frac{1}{4}</m> and <m>q=1-p=1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}</m>. Both <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> remain the same from trial to trial. This experiment is also a Bernoulli trial. It meets the characteristics two and three and <em>n</em> = 1.</p>
        <p>Example 3: Toss a fair coin five times and record the result.</p>
        <p>This is a binomial experiment since it meets all three characteristics. The number of trials <em>n</em> = 5. There are only two outcomes, head or tail, of each trial. If we define head as a success, then <em>p</em> = <em>q</em> = 0.5. Both <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> remain the same for each trial. Since n = 5, this experiment is not a Bernoulli trial although it meets the characteristics two and three.</p>
        <p>Example 4: Randomly guess 10 multiple choice questions in an exam. Each question has A, B, C and D four options.</p>
        <p>This is a binomial experiment since it meets all three characteristics. The number of trials <em>n</em> = 10. There are only two outcomes, guess correctly or guess wrong, of each trial. We can define guess correctly as a success. As we explained in example 2, <m>p=\frac{1}{4}</m> and  <m>q=1-p=1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}</m>. Both <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> remain the same for each guess. Since <em>n</em> = 10, this experiment is not a Bernoulli trial.</p>
        <p>The next two experiments are not binomial experiments.</p>
        <p>Example 5: Randomly select two balls from a jar with five red balls and five blue balls without replacement. This means we select the first ball, and then without returning the selected ball into the jar, we will select the second ball.</p>
        <p>This is not a binomial experiment since the third characteristic is not met. The number of trials <em>n</em> = 2. There are only two outcomes, a red ball or a blue ball, of each trial. If we define selecting a red ball as a success, then selecting a blue ball is a failure. The probability of getting the first ball red is <m>\frac{5}{10}</m> since there are five red balls out of 10 balls. So, <m>p=\frac{5}{10}</m> and <m> q=1-p=1-\frac{5}{10}=\frac{5}{10}</m>. However, <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> do not remain the same for the second trial. If the first ball selected is red, then the probability of getting the second ball red is <m>\frac{4}{9}</m> since there are only four red balls out of nine balls. But if the first ball selected is blue, then the probability of getting the second ball red is <m>\frac{5}{9}</m> since there are still five red balls out of nine balls.</p>
        <p>Example 6: Toss a fair coin until a head appears.</p>
        <p>This is not a binomial experiment since the first characteristic is not met. The number of trials <em>n</em> is not fixed. <em>n</em> could be 1 if a head appears from the first toss. <em>n</em> could be 2 if the first toss is a tail and the second toss is a head. So on and so forth.</p>
        <p>More examples of binomial and non-binomial experiments will be discussed in this section later.</p>

For each page, there are two possible outcomes, features signature artists or does not feature signature artists. Since we are measuring the number of pages that feature signature artists, a page that features signature artists is defined as a success and a page that does not feature signature artists is defined as a failure.

          A lacrosse team is selecting a captain. The names of all the seniors are put into a hat, and the first three that are drawn will be the captains. The names are not replaced once they are drawn (one person cannot be two captains). You want to see if the captains all play the same position. State whether this problem is binomial or not and state why.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This is not binomial because the names are not replaced, which means the probability changes for each time a name is drawn. This violates the condition of independence.

      A statistical experiment can be classified as a binomial experiment if the following conditions are met:
    </p>
    <ol marker="1.">
      <li>
        <p>There are a fixed number of trials, <em>n</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There are only two possible outcomes, called <em>success</em> and <em>failure</em>, for each trial; the letter <em>p</em> denotes the probability of a success on one trial and <em>q</em> denotes the probability of a failure on one trial</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <em>n</em> trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a binomial probability distribution. The random variable <em>X</em> = the number of successes obtained in the <em>n</em> independent trials. The mean of <em>X</em> can be calculated using the formula <em>μ</em> = <em>np</em>, and the standard deviation is given by the formula σ = <m>\text{ }\sqrt{npq}</m>.

      <em>X</em> ~ <em>B</em>(<em>n</em>, <em>p</em>) means that the discrete random variable <em>X</em> has a binomial probability distribution with <em>n</em> trials and probability of success <em>p</em>.

    <p>
      <em>X</em> = the number of successes in <em>n</em> independent trials
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>n</em> = the number of independent trials

      <em>X</em> takes on the values <em>x</em> = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , <em>n</em>

      <em>p</em> = the probability of a success for any trial

The player places a bet on a number or object. The <em>house</em> rolls three dice. If none of the dice show the number or object that was bet, the house keeps the $1 bet. If one of the dice shows the number or object bet (and the other two do not show it), the player gets back his or her $1 bet, plus $1 profit. If two of the dice show the number or object bet (and the third die does not show it), the player gets back his or her $1 bet, plus $2 profit.

          a discrete random variable (RV) that arises from Bernoulli trials; there are a fixed number, <em>n</em>, of independent trials

 <em>Independent</em> means that the result of any trial (for example, trial one) does not affect the results of the following trials, and all trials are conducted under the same conditions. Under these circumstances the binomial RV <em>X</em> is defined as the number of successes in <em>n</em> trials. The notation is: <em>X</em> ~ <em>B</em>(<em>n</em>, <em>p</em>). The mean is <em>μ</em> = <em>np</em> and the standard deviation is <em>σ</em> = <m>\sqrt{npq}</m>. The probability of the following exactly <em>x</em> successes in <em>n</em> trials is  <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> = <em>x</em>) = <m>(\binom{
      n
     }{
      x
     })</m><em>p</em><sup>x</sup><em>q</em><sup>n − x</sup>
