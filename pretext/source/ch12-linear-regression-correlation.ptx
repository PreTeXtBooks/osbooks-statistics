      <title>Chapter Objectives</title>
      <p>By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Discuss basic ideas of linear regression and correlation</li>
        <li>Create and interpret a line of best fit</li>
        <li>Calculate and interpret the correlation coefficient</li>
        <li>Calculate and interpret outliers</li>
      </ul>
    </note>
    <p>Professionals often want to know how two or more numeric variables are related. For example, is there a relationship between the grade on the second math exam a student takes and the grade on the final exam? If there is a relationship, what is the relationship, and how strong is it?</p>
    <p>In another example, your income may be determined by your education, your profession, your years of experience, and your ability. The amount you pay a repair person for labor is often determined by an initial amount plus an hourly fee.</p>
    <p>The type of data described in the examples is <term>bivariate</term> data—<m>bi</m>—for two variables. In reality, statisticians use <term>multivariate</term> data, meaning many variables.</p>
    <p>In this chapter, you will study the simplest form of regression—<em>linear regression</em>—with one independent variable (<m>x</m>). This involves data that fit a line in two dimensions. You will also study correlation, which measures the strength of a relationship.</p>

      <title>Slope and</title>
      <p>For the linear equation <m>y</m> = <m>a</m> + <m>bx</m>, <m>b</m> = slope and <m>a</m> = <m>y</m>-inttercept. From algebra, recall that the slope is a number that describes the steepness of a line; the <m>y</m>-intercept is the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the point (0, <m>a</m>), where the line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis.</p>
      <p>Please note that in previous courses you learned <m>y=mx+b</m> was the slope-intercept form of the equation, where <m>m</m> represented the slope and <m>b</m> represented the <m>y</m>-intercept. In this text, the form <m>y=a+bx</m> is used, where <m>a</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept and <m>b</m> is the slope. The key is remembering the coefficient of <m>x</m> is the slope, and the constant number is the <m>y</m>-intercept.</p>

      <title>Chapter Review</title>
      <p>The most basic type of association is a linear association. This type of relationship can be defined algebraically by the equations used (numerically with actual or predicted data values) or graphically from a plotted curve. Lines are classified as straight curves. Algebraically, a linear equation typically takes the form <em>y = mx + b</em>, where <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> are constants, <m>x</m> is the independent variable, and <m>y</m> is the dependent variable. In a statistical context, a linear equation is written in the form <em>y = a + bx</em>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the constants. This form is used to help you distinguish the statistical context from the algebraic context. In the equation <em>y = a + bx</em>, the constant <m>b</m> that multiplies the <m>x</m> variable (<m>b</m> is called a <em>coefficient</em>) is called the <em>slope</em>. The slope describes the rate of change between the independent and dependent variables; in other words, the rate of change describes the change that occurs in the dependent variable as the independent variable is changed. In the equation <em>y = a + bx</em>, the constant <m>a</m> is called the <m>y</m>-intercept. Graphically, the <m>y</m>-intercept is the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the point where the graph of the line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis. At this point, <m>x</m> = 0.</p>
      <p>The slope of a line is a value that describes the rate of change between the independent and dependent variables. The slope tells us how the dependent variable (<m>y</m>) changes for every one-unit increase in the independent (<m>x</m>) variable, on average. The <m>y</m>-intercept is used to describe the dependent variable when the independent variable equals zero. Graphically, the slope is represented by three line types in elementary statistics.</p>

      <p>The third exam score, <m>x</m>, is the independent variable, and the final exam score, <m>y</m>, is the dependent variable. We will plot a regression line that best <em>fits</em> the data. If each of you were to fit a line <em>by eye</em>, you would draw different lines. We can obtain a line of best fit using either the median-median line approach or by calculating the least-squares regression line.</p>
      <p>Let's first find the line of best fit for the relationship between the third exam score and the final exam score using the median-median line approach. Remember that this is the data from  after the ordered pairs have been listed by ordering <m>x</m> values. If multiple data points have the same <m>x</m> values, then they are listed in order from least to greatest <m>x</m> (see data values where <m>x</m> = 71). We first divide our scores into three groups of approximately equal numbers of <m>x</m> values per group. The first and third groups have the same number of <m>x</m> values. We must remember first to put the <m>x</m> values in ascending order. The corresponding <m>y</m> values are then recorded. However, to find the median, we first must rearrange the <m>y</m> values in each group from the least value to the greatest value.  shows the correct ordering of the <m>x</m> values but does not show a reordering of the <m>y</m> values.</p>

      <p>With this set of data, the first and last groups each have four <m>x</m> values and four corresponding <m>y</m> values. The second group has three <m>x</m> values and three corresponding <m>y</m> values. We need to organize the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> values per group and find the median <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> values for each group. Let’s now write out our <m>y</m> values for each group in ascending order. For group 1, the <m>y</m> values in order are 126, 133, 153, and 175. For group 2, the <m>y</m> values are already in order. For group 3, the <m>y</m> values are also already in order. We can represent these data as shown in , but notice that we have <em>broken</em> the ordered pairs; (65, 126) is not a data point in our original set:</p>

        </tabular>
      </table>
      <p>When this is completed, we can write the ordered pairs for the median values. This allows us to find the slope and <m>y</m>-intercept of the median-median line.</p>
      <p>The ordered pairs are (66.5, 143), (69, 159), and (71, 174).</p>
      <p>The slope can be calculated using the formula <m>m-\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\text{.}</m> Substituting the median <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> values from the first and third groups gives <m>m=\frac{174-143}{71-66.5}\text{,}</m> which simplifies to <m>m\approx6.9\text{.}</m></p>
      <p>The <m>y</m>-intercept may be found using the formula <m>b=\frac{\Sigmay-m\Sigmax}{3}</m>, which means the quantity of the sum of the median <m>y</m> values minus the slope times the sum of the median <m>x</m> values divided by three.</p>
      <p>The sum of the median <m>x</m> values is 206.5, and the sum of the median <m>y</m> values is 476. Substituting these sums and the slope into the formula gives <m>b=\frac{476-6.9(206.5)}{3}</m>, which simplifies to <m>b\approx-316.3\text{.}</m></p>
      <p>The line of best fit is represented as <m>y=mx+b\text{.}</m></p>
      <p>Thus, the equation can be written as <m>y</m> = 6.9<m>x</m> − 316.3.</p>
      <p>The median–median line may also be found using your graphing calculator. You can enter the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> values into two separate lists; choose Stat, Calc, Med-Med, and press Enter. The slope, <m>a</m>, and <m>y</m>-intercept, <m>b</m>, will be provided. The calculator shows a slight deviation from the previous manual calculation as a result of rounding. Rounding to the nearest tenth, the calculator gives the median-median line of <m>y=6.9x-315.5\text{.}</m> Each point of data is of the the form (<m>x</m>, <m>y</m>), and each point of the line of best fit using least-squares linear regression has the form (<m>x</m>, <m>ŷ</m>).</p>
      <p>The <m>ŷ</m> is read <em>y hat</em> and is the <em>estimated value of y</em>. It is the value of <m>y</m> obtained using the regression line. It is not generally equal to <m>y</m> from data, but it is still important because it can help make predictions for other values.</p>

          <description>The scatter plot of exam scores with a line of best fit. One data point is highlighted along with the corresponding point on the line of best fit. Both points have the same x-coordinate. The distance between these two points illustrates how to compute the sum of squared errors.</description>
        </image>
      </figure>
      <p>The term <m>y</m>_{0} – <m>ŷ</m>_{0} = <m>ε</m>_{0} is called the <em>error</em> or <em>residual</em>. It is not an error in the sense of a mistake. The <em>absolute value of a residual</em> measures the vertical distance between the actual value of <m>y</m> and the estimated value of <m>y</m>. In other words, it measures the vertical distance between the actual data point and the predicted point on the line, or it measures how far the estimate is from the actual data value.</p>
      <p>If the observed data point lies above the line, the residual is positive and the line underestimates the actual data value for <m>y</m>. If the observed data point lies below the line, the residual is negative and the line overestimates that actual data value for <m>y</m>.</p>
      <p>In , <m>y</m>_{0} – <m>ŷ</m>_{0} = ε_{0} is the residual for the point shown. Here the point lies above the line and the residual is positive.</p>
      <p><m>ε</m> = the Greek letter epsilon</p>
      <p>For each data point, you can calculate the residuals or errors, <m>y</m>_{i}  <m>ŷ</m>_{i} = <m>ε</m>_{i} for <m>i</m> = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 11.</p>
      <p>Each |<m>ε</m>| is a vertical distance.</p>
      <p>For the example about the third exam scores and the final exam scores for the 11 statistics students, there are 11 data points. Therefore, there are 11 <m>ε</m> values. If you square each <m>ε</m> and add them, you get the sum of <m>ε</m> squared from <m>i</m> = 1 to <m>i</m> = 11, as shown below.</p>
      <p><m>(ε_{1})^{2}+(ε_{2})^{2}+...+(ε_{11})^{2}=\Sigmai=1ε^{2}\text{.}</m></p>
      <p>This is called the <term>sum of squared errors (SSE)</term>.</p>
      <p>Using calculus, you can determine the values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> that make the SSE a minimum. When you make the SSE a minimum, you have determined the points that are on the line of best fit. It turns out that the line of best fit has the equation</p>
      <me>ŷ=a+bx</me>
      <p>where</p>
      <p><m>a=\overline{y}-b\overline{x}</m></p>
      <p>and <m>b=\frac{∑(x-\overline{x})(y-\overline{y})}{∑(x-\overline{x})^{2}}</m>.</p>
      <p>The sample means of the <m>x</m> values and the <m>y</m> values are <m>\overline{x}</m> and <m>\overline{y}</m>, respectively. The best-fit line always passes through the point <m>(\overline{x},\overline{y})</m>.</p>
      <p>The slope (<m>b</m>) can be written as <m>b=r(\frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}})</m> where <m>s</m>_{<m>y</m>} = the standard deviation of the <m>y</m> values and <m>s</m>_{<m>x</m>} = the standard deviation of the <m>x</m> values. <m>r</m> is the correlation coefficient, which shows the relationship between the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> values. This will be discussed in more detail in the next section.</p>

      <title>Least-Squares Criteria for Best Fit</title>
      <p>The process of fitting the best-fit line is called linear regression. We assume that the data are scattered about a straight line. To find that line, we minimize the sum of the squared errors (SSE), or make it as small as possible. Any other line you might choose would have a higher SSE than the best-fit line. This best-fit line is called the <em>least-squares regression line</em>.</p>

        <p>Computer spreadsheets, statistical software, and many calculators can quickly calculate the best-fit line and create the graphs. The calculations tend to be tedious if done by hand.

      <title>Understanding and Interpreting the</title>
      <p>The <m>y</m>-intercept, <m>a</m>, of the line describes where the plot line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis. The <m>y</m>-intercept of the best-fit line tells us the best value of the relationship when <m>x</m> is zero. In some cases, it does not make sense to figure out what <m>y</m> is when <m>x</m> = 0. For example, in the third exam vs. final exam example, the <m>y</m>-intercept occurs when the third exam score, or <m>x</m>, is zero. Since all the scores are grouped around a passing grade, there is no need to figure out what the final exam score, or <m>y</m>, would be when the third exam was zero.</p>
      <p>However, the <m>y</m>-intercept is very useful in many cases. For many examples in science, the <m>y</m>-intercept gives the baseline reading when the experimental conditions aren't applied to an experimental system. This baseline indicates how much the experimental condition affects the system. It could also be used to ensure that equipment and measurements are calibrated properly before starting the experiment.</p>
      <p>In biology, the concentration of proteins in a sample can be measured using a chemical assay that changes color depending on how much protein is present. The more protein present, the darker the color. The amount of color can be measured by the absorbance reading.  shows the expected absorbance readings at different protein concentrations. This is called a <em>standard curve</em> for the assay.</p>

      <p>The <m>y</m>-intercept of this line occurs at 0.0226 mAU. This means the assay gives a reading of 0.0226 mAU when there is no protein present. That is, it is the baseline reading that can be attributed to something else, which, in this case, is some other non-protein chemicals that are absorbing light. We can tell that this line of best fit is reasonable because the <m>y</m>-intercept is small, close to zero. When there is no protein present in the sample, we expect the absorbance to be very small, or close to zero, as well.</p>

      <title>The Correlation Coefficient</title>
      <p>Besides looking at the scatter plot and seeing that a line seems reasonable, how can you determine whether the line is a good predictor? Use the correlation coefficient as another indicator (besides the scatter plot) of the strength of the relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.</p>
      <p>The correlation coefficient, <m>r</m>, developed by Karl Pearson during the early 1900s, is numeric and provides a measure of the strength and direction of the linear association between the independent variable <m>x</m> and the dependent variable <m>y</m>.</p>
      <p>If you suspect a linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, then <m>r</m> can measure the strength of the linear relationship.</p>
      <p>What the Value of <m>r</m> Tells Us

The value of <m>r</m> is always between –1 and +1. In other words, –1 ≤ <m>r</m> ≤ 1.
The size of the correlation <m>r</m> indicates the strength of the linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. Values of <m>r</m> close to –1 or to +1 indicate a stronger linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.

If <m>r</m> = 0, there is absolutely no linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> (no linear correlation).
If <m>r</m> = 1, there is perfect positive correlation. If <m>r</m> = –1, there is perfect negative correlation. In both these cases, all the original data points lie on a straight line. Of course, in the real world, this does not generally happen.</p>
      <p>What the Sign of <m>r</m> Tells Us
A positive value of <m>r</m> means that when <m>x</m> increases, <m>y</m> tends to increase and when <m>x</m> decreases, <m>y</m> tends to decrease (positive correlation).
A negative value of <m>r</m> means that when <m>x</m> increases, <m>y</m> tends to decrease and when <m>x</m> decreases, <m>y</m> tends to increase (negative correlation).
The sign of <m>r</m> is the same as the sign of the slope, <m>b</m>, of the best-fit line.</p>
      <note xml:id="eip-131">
        <title>Note</title>
      </note>
      <p>The correlation coefficient is calculated as the quantity of data points times the sum of the quantity of the <m>x</m>-coordinates times the <m>y</m>-coordinates, minus the quantity of the sum of the <m>x</m>-coordinates times the sum of the <m>y</m>-coordinates, all divided by the square root of the quantity of data points times the sum of the <m>x</m>-coordinates squared minus the square of the sum of the <m>x</m>-coordinates, times the number of data points times the sum of the <m>y</m>-coordinates squared minus the square of the sum of the <m>y</m>-coordinates. It can be summarized by the following equation:</p>
      <p><m>r=\frac{n\Sigma(xy)-(\Sigmax)(\Sigmay)}{\sqrt{[n\Sigmax^{2}-(\Sigmax)^{2}][n\Sigmay^{2}-(\Sigmay)^{2}]}}</m></p>

    <p>The formula for <m>r</m> looks formidable. However, computer spreadsheets, statistical software, and many calculators can calculate <m>r</m> quickly. The correlation coefficient, <m>r</m>, is the bottom item in the output screens for the LinRegTTest on the TI-83, TI-83+, or TI-84+ calculator (see previous section for instructions).</p>

    <subsection xml:id="eip-117">
      <title>The Coefficient of Determination</title>
      <p>The variable <m>r</m>^{2} is called the <term>coefficient of determination</term> and it is the square of the correlation coefficient, but it is usually stated as a percentage, rather than in decimal form. It has an interpretation in the context of the data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><m>r^{2}\text{,}</m> when expressed as a percent, represents the percentage of variation in the dependent (predicted) variable <m>y</m> that can be explained by variation in the independent (explanatory) variable <m>x</m> using the regression (best-fit) line.</li>
        <li>1 – <m>r^{2}\text{,}</m> when expressed as a percentage, represents the percentage of variation in <m>y</m> that is <em>not</em> explained by variation in <m>x</m> using the regression line. This can be seen as the scattering of the observed data points about the regression line.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Consider the third exam/final exam example introduced in the previous section.<nbsp />
The line of best fit is: <m>ŷ</m> = –173.51 + 4.83<m>x</m>.
 The correlation coefficient is <m>r</m> = .6631.
The coefficient of determination is <m>r</m>^{2} = .6631^{2} = .4397.</p>
      <p>Interpret <m>r</m>^{2} in the context of this example.<nbsp />
Approximately 44 percent of the variation (0.4397 is approximately 0.44) in the final exam grades can be explained by the variation in the grades on the third exam, using the best-fit regression line.
Therefore, the rest of the variation (1 – 0.44 = 0.56 or 56 percent) in the final exam grades cannot be explained by the variation of the grades on the third exam with the best-fit regression line. These are the variation of the points that are not as close to the regression line as others.</p>

      <title>Chapter Review</title>
      <p>A regression line, or a line of best fit, can be drawn on a scatter plot and used to predict outcomes for the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> variables in a given data set or sample data. There are several ways to find a regression line, but usually the least-squares regression line is used because it creates a uniform line. Residuals, also called <em>errors</em>, measure the distance from the actual value of <m>y</m> and the estimated value of <m>y</m>. The sum of squared errors, or SSE, when set to its minimum, calculates the points on the line of best fit. Regression lines can be used to predict values within the given set of data but should not be used to make predictions for values outside the set of data.</p>
      <p>The correlation coefficient, <m>r</m>, measures the strength of the linear association between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. The variable <m>r</m> has to be between –1 and +1. When <m>r</m> is positive, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> tend to increase and decrease together. When <m>r</m> is negative, <m>x</m> increases and <m>y</m> decreases, or the opposite occurs: <m>x</m> decreases and <m>y</m> increases. The coefficient of determination, <m>r</m>^{2}, is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient. When expressed as a percentage, <m>r</m>^{2} represents the percentage of variation in the dependent variable, <m>y</m>, that can be explained by variation in the independent variable, <m>x</m>, using the regression line.</p>

    <title>Testing the Significance of the Correlation Coefficient</title>


    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164565134582">
      <p>The correlation coefficient, <m>r</m>, tells us about the strength and direction of the linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. However, the reliability of the linear model also depends on how many observed data points are in the sample. We need to look at both the correlation coefficient <m>r</m> and the sample size <m>n</m>, together.</p>
      <p>We perform a hypothesis test of the <em>significance of the correlation coefficient</em> to decide whether the linear relationship in the sample data is strong enough to use to model the relationship in the population.</p>
      <p>The sample data are used to compute <m>r</m>, the correlation coefficient for the sample. If we had data for the entire population, we could find the population correlation coefficient. But, because we have only sample data, we cannot calculate the population correlation coefficient. The sample correlation coefficient, <m>r</m>, is our estimate of the unknown population correlation coefficient.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The symbol for the population correlation coefficient is <m>ρ</m>, the Greek letter rho.</li>
        <li><m>ρ</m> = population correlation coefficient (unknown).</li>
        <li><m>r</m> = sample correlation coefficient (known; calculated from sample data).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The hypothesis test lets us decide whether the value of the population correlation coefficient <m>ρ</m> is <em>close to zero</em> or <em>significantly different from zero</em>. We decide this based on the sample correlation coefficient <m>r</m> and the sample size <m>n</m>.</p>
      <p>If the test concludes the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, we say the correlation coefficient is <em>significant</em>.

Conclusion: There is sufficient evidence to conclude there is a significant  linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> because the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero.
What the conclusion means: There is a significant linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. We can use the regression line to model the linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the population.</p>
      <p>If the test concludes the correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero (it is close to zero), we say the correlation coefficient is <em>not significant</em>.

Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to conclude there is a significant  linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> because the correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero.
What the conclusion means: There is not a significant linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. Therefore, we <em>cannot</em> use the regression line to model a linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the population.</p>

      <p>Testing the significance of the correlation coefficient requires that certain assumptions about the data be satisfied.

We are examining the sample to draw a conclusion about whether the linear relationship that we see between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the sample data provides strong enough evidence that we can conclude there is a linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the population.</p>
      <p>The regression line equation that we calculate from the sample data gives the best-fit line for our particular sample.

      <ul>
        <li>Linear: In the population, there is a linear relationship that models the average value of <m>y</m> for different values of <m>x</m>.</li>
        <li>Independent: The residuals are assumed to be independent.</li>
        <li>Normal: The <m>y</m> values are distributed normally for any value of <m>x</m>.</li>
        <li>Equal variance: The standard deviation of the <m>y</m> values is equal for each <m>x</m> value.</li>
        <li>Random: The data are produced from a well-designed random sample or a randomized experiment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The slope <m>b</m> and intercept <m>a</m> of the least-squares line estimate the slope <m>β</m> and intercept <m>α</m> of the population (true) regression line. To estimate the population standard deviation of <m>y</m> (<m>σ</m>) use the standard deviation of the residuals: <m>s=\sqrt{\frac{\text{SSE}}{n-2}}</m>. The variable <m>ρ</m> (rho) is the population correlation coefficient. To test the null hypothesis, <m>H</m>_{0}: <m>ρ</m> = hypothesized value, use a linear regression <m>t</m>-test. The most common null hypothesis is <m>H</m>_{0}: <m>ρ</m> = 0, which indicates there is no linear relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the population. The TI-83, 83+, 84, 84+ calculator function LinRegTTest can perform this test (STATS, TESTS, LinRegTTest).</p>

      <p>We found the equation of the best-fit line for the final exam grade as a function of the grade on the third exam. We can now use the least-squares regression line for prediction.</p>
      <p>Suppose you want to estimate, or predict, the mean final exam score of statistics students who received a 73 on the third exam. The exam scores (<m>x</m> values) range from 65 to 75. Since 73 is between the <m>x</m> values 65 and 75, substitute <m>x</m> = 73 into the equation. Then,</p>
      <me>y=-173.51+4.83(73)=179.08\text{.}</me>
      <p>We predict that statistics students who earn a grade of 73 on the third exam will earn a grade of 179.08 on the final exam, on average.</p>

    <title>Outliers</title>


    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164566957266">
      <p>In some data sets, there are values (observed data points) called outliers. Outliers are observed data points that are far from the least-squares line. They have large errors, where the error or residual is not very close to the best-fit line.</p>
      <p>Outliers need to be examined closely. Sometimes, they should not be included in the analysis of the data, like if it is possible that an outlier is a result of incorrect data. Other times, an outlier may hold valuable information about the population under study and should remain included in the data. The key is to examine carefully what causes a data point to be an outlier.</p>
      <p>Besides outliers, a sample may contain one or a few points that are called influential points. Influential points are observed data points that are far from the other observed data points in the horizontal direction. These points may have a big effect on the slope of the regression line. To begin to identify an influential point, you can remove it from the data set and determine whether the slope of the regression line is changed significantly.</p>
      <p>You also want to examine how the correlation coefficient, <m>r</m>, has changed. Sometimes, it is difficult to discern a significant change in slope, so you need to look at how the strength of the linear relationship has changed. Computers and many calculators can be used to identify outliers and influential points. Regression analysis can determine if an outlier is, indeed, an influential point. The new regression will show how omitting the outlier will affect the correlation among the variables, as well as the fit of the line. A graph showing both regression lines helps determine how removing an outlier affects the fit of the model.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="fs-idm49430544">
      <title>Identifying Outliers</title>
      <p>We could guess at outliers by looking at a graph of the scatter plot and best-fit line. However, we would like some guideline regarding how far away a point needs to be to be considered an outlier. <em>As a rough rule of thumb, we can flag as an outlier any point that is located farther than two standard deviations above or below the best-fit line</em>. The standard deviation used is the standard deviation of the residuals or errors.</p>
      <p>We can do this visually in the scatter plot by drawing an extra pair of lines that are two standard deviations above and below the best-fit line. Any data points outside this extra pair of lines are flagged as potential outliers. Or, we can do this numerically by calculating each residual and comparing it with twice the standard deviation. With regard to the TI-83, 83+, or 84+ calculators, the graphical approach is easier. The graphical procedure is shown first, followed by the numerical calculations. You would generally need to use only one of these methods.</p>

          <p>In the <url href="m79689">third exam/final exam example</url>, you can determine whether there is an outlier. If there is an outlier, as an exercise, delete it and fit the remaining data to a new line. For this example, the new line ought to fit the remaining data better. This means the SSE (sum of the squared errors) should be smaller and the correlation coefficient ought to be closer to 1 or –1.</p>

        <solution>
          <p>Graphical Identification of OutliersWith the TI-83, 83+, or 84+ graphing calculators, it is easy to  identify the outliers graphically and visually. If we were to measure the vertical distance from any data point to the corresponding point on the line of best fit and that distance were equal to 2<m>s</m> or more, then we would consider the data point to be too far from the line of best fit. We need to find and graph the lines that are two standard deviations below and above the regression line. Any points that are outside these two lines are outliers. Let’s call these lines Y2 and Y3.</p>
          <p>As we did with the equation of the regression line and the correlation coefficient, we will use technology to calculate this standard deviation for us. Using the LinRegTTest with these data, scroll down through the output screens to find <m>s</m> = 16.412.</p>
          <p>Line Y2 = –173.5 + 4.83<m>x</m> – 2(16.4), and line Y3 = –173.5 + 4.83<m>x</m> + 2(16.4),<nbsp />where <m>ŷ</m> = –173.5 + 4.83<m>x</m> is the line of best fit. Y2 and Y3 have the same slope as the line of best fit.</p>
          <p>Graph the scatter plot with the best-fit line in equation Y1, then enter the two extra lines as Y2 and Y3 in the <m>Y</m>= equation editor. Press ZOOM-9 to get a good view. You will see that the only point that is not between Y2 and Y3 is the point (65, 175). On the calculator screen, it is barely outside these lines, but it is considered an outlier because it is more than two standard deviations away from the best-fit line. The outlier is the student who had a grade of 65 on the third exam and 175 on the final exam.</p>
          <p>Sometimes a point is so close to the lines used to flag outliers on the graph that it is difficult to tell whether the point is between or outside the lines. On a computer, enlarging the graph may help;  on a small calculator screen, zooming in may make the graph clearer. Note that when the graph does not give a clear enough picture, you can use the numerical comparisons to identify outliers.</p>

      <title>How Does the Outlier Affect the Best-Fit Line?</title>
      <p>Numerically and graphically, we have identified point (65, 175) as an outlier. Recall that recalculation of the least-squares regression line and summary statistics, following deletion of an outlier, may be used to determine whether an outlier is also an influential point. This process also allows you to compare the strength of the correlation of the variables and possible changes in the slope both before and after the omission of any outliers.</p>
      <p>Compute a new best-fit line and correlation coefficient using the 10 remaining points.</p>
      <p>On the TI-83, TI-83+, or TI-84+ calculators, delete the outlier from L1 and L2. Using the LinRegTTest, found under Stat and Tests, the new line of best fit and correlation coefficient are the following:</p>
      <p><m>ŷ=-355.19+7.39x</m> and <m>r=0.9121</m>.</p>
      <p>The slope is now 7.39, compared to the previous slope of 4.83. This seems significant, but we need to look at the change in <m>r</m>-values as well. The new line shows <m>r=0.9121</m>, which indicates a stronger correlation than the original line, with <m>r=0.6631\text{,}</m> since <m>r=0.9121</m> is closer to 1. This means the new line is a better fit to the data values. The line can better predict the final exam score given the third exam score. It also means the outlier of (65, 175) was an influential point, since there is a sizeable difference in <m>r</m>-values. We must now decide whether to delete the outlier. If the outlier was recorded erroneously, it should certainly be deleted. Because it produces such a profound effect on the correlation, the new line of best fit allows for better prediction and an overall stronger model.</p>
      <p>You may use Excel to graph the two least-squares regression lines and compare the slopes and fit of the lines to the data, as shown in .</p>

        <image source="media/CNX_Stats_figure_12_06_01.jpg" width="76%" />
      </figure>
      <p>You can see that the second graph shows less deviation from the line of best fit. It is clear that omission of the influential point produced a line of best fit that more closely models the data.</p>

      <title>Numerical Identification of Outliers: Calculating</title>
      <p>If you do not have the function LinRegTTest on your calculator, then you must calculate the outlier in the first example by doing the following.
<nbsp /><nbsp />
First, square each |<m>y</m> – <m>ŷ</m>|.</p>
      <p>The squares are 
35^{2}
17^{2}
16^{2}
6^{2}
19^{2}
9^{2}
3^{2}
1^{2}
10^{2}
9^{2}
1^{2}.</p>
      <p>Then, add (sum) all the |<m>y</m> – <m>ŷ</m>| squared terms using the formula</p>
      <p><m>\Sigmai=111(|y_{i}-ŷ_{i}|)^{2}=\Sigmai=111ε_{i}^{2}</m> (Recall that <m>y</m>_{i} – <m>ŷ</m>_{i} = <m>ε</m>_{i}).</p>
      <p>= 35^{2} + 17^{2} + 16^{2} + 6^{2} + 19^{2} + 9^{2} + 3^{2} + 1^{2} + 10^{2} + 9^{2} + 1^{2}</p>
      <p>= 2,440 =  SSE.</p>
      <p>The result, SSE, is the sum of squared errors.</p>
      <p>Next, calculate <m>s</m>, the standard deviation of all the <m>y</m> – <m>ŷ</m> = <m>ε</m>-values where <m>n</m> = the total number of data points.</p>
      <p>The calculation is <m>s=\sqrt{\text{SSE}n-2}</m>.</p>
      <p>For the third exam/final exam example, <m>s=\sqrt{244011-2}=16.47.</m></p>
      <p>Next, multiply <m>s</m> by 2:
<nbsp />(2)(16.47) = 32.94
<nbsp />32.94 is two standard deviations away from the mean of the <m>y</m> – <m>ŷ</m> values.</p>
      <p>If we were to measure the vertical distance from any data point to the corresponding point on the line of best fit and that distance is at least 2<m>s</m>, then we would consider the data point to be too far from the line of best fit. We call that point a <term>potential outlier</term>.</p>
      <p>For the example, if any of the |<m>y</m> – <m>ŷ</m>| values are <em>at least</em> 32.94, the corresponding (<m>x</m>, <m>y</m>) data point is a potential outlier.</p>
      <p>For the third exam/final exam example, all the |<m>y</m> – <m>ŷ</m>| values are less than 31.29 except for the first one, which is 35:</p>
      <p>35 &gt; 31.29. That is, |<m>y</m> – <m>ŷ</m>| ≥ (2)(<m>s</m>).</p>
      <p>The point that corresponds to |<m>y</m> – <m>ŷ</m>| = 35 is (65, 175). <em>Therefore, the data point (65, 175) is a potential outlier.</em> For this example, we will delete it. (Remember, we do not always delete an outlier.)

Note
When outliers are deleted, the researcher should either record that data were deleted, and why, or the researcher should provide results both with and without the deleted data. If data are erroneous and the correct values are known (e.g., student 1 actually scored a 70 instead of a 65), then this correction can be made to the data.<nbsp /><nbsp />The next step is to compute a new best-fit line using the 10 remaining points. The new line of best fit and the correlation coefficient are</p>
      <p><m>ŷ</m> = –355.19 + 7.39<m>x</m> and <m>r</m> = .9121.</p>
      <example xml:id="element-824">
        <statement>
          <p>Using this new line of best fit (based on the remaining 10 data points  in the <url href="m79689">third exam/final exam example</url>), what would a student who receives a 73 on the third exam expect to receive on the final exam? Is this the same as the prediction made using the original line?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Using the new line of best fit, <m>ŷ</m> = –355.19 + 7.39(73) = 184.28. A student who scored 73 points on the third exam would expect to earn 184 points on the final exam.
<nbsp /><nbsp />
The original line predicted that <m>ŷ</m> = –173.51 + 4.83(73) = 179.08, so the prediction using the new line with the outlier eliminated differs from the original prediction.</p>

      <p>To determine whether a point is an outlier, do one of the following:
        Input the following equations into the TI 83, 83+, 84, or 84+ calculator:
        <nbsp /><m>y_{1}=a+bx \\ y_{2}=a+bx+\text{2}s \\ y_{3}=a+bx-\text{2}s</m>where <m>s</m> is the standard deviation of the residuals.If any point is above <m>y</m>_{2} or below <m>y</m>_{3}, then the point is considered to be an outlier.

        Use the residuals and compare their absolute values to 2<m>s</m>, where <m>s</m> is the standard deviation of the residuals. If the absolute value of any residual is greater than or equal to 2<m>s</m>, then the corresponding point is an outlier.

        Note: The calculator function LinRegTTest (STATS, TESTS, LinRegTTest) calculates <m>s</m>.</p>

          <p>Marcus states that all outliers are influential points. Is he correct? Explain.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>No, he is not correct. An outlier is only an influential point if it significantly impacts the slope of the least-squares regression line and the correlation coefficient, <m>r</m>. If omission of this data point from the calculation of the regression line does not show much impact on the slope or <m>r</m>-value, then the outlier is not considered an influential point. For different reasons, it still may be determined that the data point must be omitted from the data set.</p>

          <p>a. and b. Check student solution.</p>
          <p>c. The slope of the regression line is 0.3031 with a <m>y</m>-intercept of 31.93. In context, the <m>y</m>-intercept indicates that when there are no returning sparrow hawks, there will be almost 32 percent new sparrow hawks, which doesn’t make sense, because if there are no returning birds, then the new percentage would have to be 100% (this is an example of why we do not extrapolate). The slope tells us that for each percentage increase in returning birds, the percentage of new birds in the colony decreases by 30.3 percent.</p>
          <p>d. If we examine <m>r</m>_{2}, we see that only 57.52 percent of the variation in the percentage of new birds is explained by the model and the correlation coefficient, <m>r</m> = .7584 only indicates a somewhat strong correlation between returning and new percentages.</p>
          <p>e. The ordered pair (66, 6) generates the largest residual of 6.0. This means that when the observed return percentage is 66 percent, our observed new percentage, 6 percent, is almost 6 percent less than the predicted new value of 11.98 percent. If we remove this data pair, we see only an adjusted slope of 0.2789 and an adjusted intercept of 30.9816. In other words, although these data generate the largest residual, it is not an outlier, nor is the data pair an influential point.</p>
          <p>f. If there are 70 percent returning birds, we would expect to see <m>y</m> = 0.2789(70) + 30.9816 = 0.114 or 11.4 percent new birds in the colony.</p>

            <li>We have a slope of –1.4946 with a <m>y</m>-intercept of 193.88. The slope, in context, indicates that for each additional minute added to the swim time, the heart rate decreases by 1.5 beats per minute. If the student is not swimming at all, the <m>y</m>-intercept indicates that his heart rate will be 193.88 beats per minute. Although the slope has meaning (the longer it takes to swim 2000 m, the less effort the heart puts out), the <m>y</m>-intercept does not make sense. If the athlete is not swimming (resting), then his heart rate should be very low.</li>
            <li>Because only 1.5 percent of the heart rate variation is explained by this regression equation, we must conclude that this association is not explained with a linear relationship.</li>
            <li>Point (34.72, 124) generates the largest residual: –11.82. This means that our observed heart rate is almost 12 beats less than our predicted rate of 136 beats per minute.
