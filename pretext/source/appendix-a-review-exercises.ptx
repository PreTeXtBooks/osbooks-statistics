However, out of all of the mothers in the population, 49 percent work full-time. The population under study is made up of mothers of junior high school children in Santa Clara County.

      <em>137.</em> The ages of De Anza evening students is known to be normally distributed with a population mean of 40 and a population standard deviation of six. A sample of six De Anza evening students reported their ages in years as: 28; 35; 47; 45; 30; 50. Find the probability that the mean of six ages of randomly chosen students is less than 35 years. Hint—Find the sample mean.
