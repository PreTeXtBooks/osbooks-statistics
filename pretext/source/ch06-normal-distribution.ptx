      <title>Chapter Objectives</title>
      <p>By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognize the normal probability distribution and apply it appropriately</li>
        <li>Recognize the standard normal probability distribution and apply it appropriately</li>
        <li>Compare normal probabilities by converting to the standard normal distribution</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>

    <p>The normal, a continuous distribution, is the most important of all the distributions. It is widely used and even more widely abused. Its graph is bell-shaped. You see the bell curve in almost all disciplines, including psychology, business, economics, the sciences, nursing, and, of course, mathematics. Some of your instructors may use the <alert>normal distribution</alert> to help determine your grade. Most IQ scores are normally distributed. Often, real-estate prices fit a normal distribution. The normal distribution is extremely important, but it cannot be applied to everything in the real world.</p>

    <p>In this chapter, you will study the normal distribution, the standard normal distribution, and applications associated with them.</p>

    <p>The normal distribution has two parameters: the mean (<m>μ</m>) and the standard deviation (<m>σ</m>). If <m>X</m> is a quantity to be measured that has a normal distribution with mean (<m>μ</m>) and standard deviation (<m>σ</m>), we designate this by writing </p>

    <p>The curve is symmetric about a vertical line drawn through the mean, <m>μ</m>. In theory, the mean is the same as the median, because the graph is symmetric about <m>μ</m>. With a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode all lie at the same point. The normal distribution depends only on the mean and the standard deviation. The location of the mean simply indicates the location of the line of symmetry, in a normal distribution. Since the area under the curve must equal one, a change in the standard deviation, <m>σ</m>, causes a change in the shape of the curve; the curve becomes fatter or skinnier depending on <m>σ</m>. A change in <m>μ</m> causes the graph to shift to the left or right. The location of the mean simply indicates the location of the line of symmetry, in a normal distribution. This means there are an infinite number of normal probability distributions. One distribution of special interest is called the standard normal distribution.</p>

    <p>Your instructor will record the heights of both men and women in your class, separately. Draw histograms of your data. Then draw a smooth curve through each histogram. Is each curve somewhat bell-shaped? Do you think that if you had recorded 200 data values for men and 200 for women that the curves would look bell-shaped? Calculate the mean for each data set. Write the means on the <m>x</m>-axis of the appropriate graph below the peak. Shade the approximate area that represents the probability that one randomly chosen male is taller than 72 inches. Shade the approximate area that represents the probability that one randomly chosen female is shorter than 60 inches. If the total area under each curve is one, does either probability appear to be more than 0.5?</p>

    <title>The Standard Normal Distribution</title>


    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164562165107">
      <p>The standardized normal distribution is a type of normal distribution, with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. It represents a distribution of standardized scores, called <alert><m>z</m>-scores</alert>, as opposed to raw scores (the actual data values). A <m>z</m>-score indicates the number of standard deviation a score falls above or below the mean. <m>Z</m>-scores allow for comparison of scores, occurring in different data sets, with different means and standard deviations. It would not make sense to compare apples and oranges. Likewise, it does not make sense to compare scores from two different samples that have different means and standard deviations. <m>Z</m>-scores can be looked up in a <m>Z</m>-Table of Standard Normal Distribution, in order to find the area under the standard normal curve, between a score and the mean, between two scores, or above or below a score. The standard normal distribution allows us to interpret standardized scores and provides us with one table that we may use, in order to compute areas under the normal curve, for an infinite number of data sets, no matter what the mean or standard deviation.</p>
      <p>A <m>z</m>-score is calculated as <m>z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}</m>. The score itself can be found by using algebra and solving for <m>x</m>. Multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>σ</m> gives: <m>(z)(\sigma)=x-\mu</m>. Adding <m>μ</m> to both sides of the equation gives <m>\mu+(z)(\sigma)=x</m>.</p>
      <p>Suppose we have a data set with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2. We want to determine the number of standard deviations the score of 11 falls above the mean. We can find this answer (or <m>z</m>-score) by writing</p>
      <me>z=\frac{11-5}{2}=3</me>
      <p>or</p>
      <me>5+(z)(2)=11\text{,}</me>
      <p>we can solve for <m>z</m>.</p>
      <me>2z=6 \\ z=3</me>
      <p>We have determined that the score of 11 falls 3 standard deviations above the mean of 5.</p>
      <p>With a standard normal distribution, we indicate the distribution by writing <m>Z</m> ~ <m>N</m>(0, 1) which shows the normal distribution has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This notation simply indicates that a standard normal distribution is being used.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="fs-idp52480624">
      <p>As described previously, if <m>X</m> is a normally distributed random variable and <m>X</m> ~ <em>N(μ, σ)</em>, then the <m>z</m>-score is</p>
      <me>z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\text{.}</me>
      <p>The <m>z</m>-score tells you how many standard deviations the value <m>x</m> is above, to the right of, or below, to the left of, the mean, <m>μ</m>. Values of <m>x</m> that are larger than the mean have positive <m>z</m>-scores, and values of <m>x</m> that are smaller than the mean have negative <m>z</m>-scores. If <m>x</m> equals the mean, then <m>x</m> has a <m>z</m>-score of zero.</p>
      <p>When determining the <m>z</m>-score for an <m>x</m>-value, for a normal distribution, with a given mean and standard deviation, the notation above for a normal distribution, will be given.</p>
      <example xml:id="element-49">
        <statement>
          <p>Suppose <m>X</m> ~ <em>N(5, 6)</em>. This equation says that <m>X</m> is a normally distributed random variable with mean <m>μ</m> = 5 and standard deviation <m>σ</m> = 6. Suppose <m>x</m> = 17. Then,</p>
          <me>z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}=\frac{17-5}{6}=2\text{.}</me>
          <p>This means that <m>x</m> = 17 is two standard deviations (2<m>σ</m>) above, or to the right, of the mean <m>μ</m> = 5.</p>
          <p>Notice that 5 + (2)(6) = 17. The pattern is <m>μ</m> + <m>zσ</m> = <m>x</m>.</p>
          <p>Now suppose <m>x</m> = 1. Then, <m>z</m> = <m>\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}</m> = <m>\frac{1-5}{6}</m> = –0.67, rounded to two decimal places.</p>
          <p><em>This means that <m>x</m> = 1 is 0.67 standard deviations (–0.67<m>σ</m>) below or to the left of the mean <m>μ</m> = 5.</em> This <m>z</m>-score shows that <m>x</m> = 1 is less than 1 standard deviation below the mean of 5. Therefore, the score doesn't fall very far below the mean.</p>
          <p>Summarizing, when <m>z</m> is positive, <m>x</m> is above or to the right of <m>μ</m>, and when <m>z</m> is negative, <m>x</m> is to the left of or below <m>μ</m>. Or, when <m>z</m> is positive, <m>x</m> is greater than <m>μ</m>, and when <m>z</m> is negative, <m>x</m> is less than <m>μ</m>. The absolute value of <m>z</m> indicates how far the score is from the mean, in either direction.</p>

      <p>The Empirical Rule If <m>X</m> is a random variable and has a normal distribution with mean <m>µ</m> and standard deviation <m>σ</m>, then the <term>Empirical Rule</term> states the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>About 68 percent of the <m>x</m> values lie between –1<m>σ</m> and +1<m>σ</m> of the mean <m>µ</m> (within one standard deviation of the mean).</li>
        <li>About  95 percent of the <m>x</m> values lie between –2<m>σ</m> and +2<m>σ</m> of the mean <m>µ</m> (within two standard deviations of the mean).</li>
        <li>About 99.7 percent of the <m>x</m> values lie between –3<m>σ</m> and +3<m>σ</m> of the mean <m>µ</m> (within three standard deviations of the mean). Notice that almost all the <m>x</m> values lie within three standard deviations of the mean.</li>
        <li>The <m>z</m>-scores for +1<m>σ</m> and –1<m>σ</m> are +1 and –1, respectively.</li>
        <li>The <m>z</m>-scores for +2<m>σ</m>  and –2<m>σ</m> are +2 and –2, respectively.</li>
        <li>The <m>z</m>-scores for +3<m>σ</m>  and –3<m>σ</m> are +3 and –3, respectively.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, in other words, this is that about 68 percent of the values lie between <m>z</m>-scores of –1 and 1, about 95% of the values lie between <m>z</m>-scores of –2 and 2, and about 99.7 percent of the values lie between <m>z</m>-scores of -3 and 3. These facts can be checked, by looking up the mean to <m>z</m> area in a <m>z</m>-table for each positive <m>z</m>-score and multiplying by 2.</p>
      <p>The empirical rule is also known as the <em>68–95–99.7 rule</em>.</p>

      <p>A <m>z</m>-score is a standardized value. Its distribution is the standard normal, <m>Z</m> ~ <m>N</m>(0, 1). The mean of the <m>z</m>-scores is zero and the standard deviation is one. If <m>z</m> is the <m>z</m>-score for a value <m>x</m> from the normal distribution <m>N</m>(<m>µ</m>, <m>σ</m>), then <m>z</m> tells you how many standard deviations <m>x</m> is abovegreater thanor belowless than<m>µ</m>.</p>

      <title>Calculations of Probabilities</title>
      <p>Probabilities are calculated using technology. There are instructions given as necessary for the TI-83+ and TI-84 calculators.</p>

        <title>NOTE</title>
        <p>To calculate the probability, use the probability tables provided in <xref ref="appendix-h-tables" /> without the use of technology. The tables include instructions for how to use them.</p>
        <p>The probability is represented by the area under the normal curve. To find the probability, calculate the <m>z</m>-score and look up the <m>z</m>-score in the z-table under the <m>z</m>-column. Most <m>z</m>-tables show the area under the normal curve to the left of <m>z</m>. Others show the mean to <m>z</m> area. The method used will be indicated on the table.</p>
        <p>We will discuss the <m>z</m>-table that represents the area under the normal curve to the left of <m>z</m>. Once you have located the <m>z</m>-score, locate the corresponding area. This will be the area under the normal curve, to the left of the <m>z</m>-score. This area can be used to find the area to the right of the <m>z</m>-score, or by subtracting from 1 or the total area under the normal curve. These areas can also be used to determine the area between two <m>z</m>-scores.</p>

          <p>a. Find the probability that a randomly selected student scored more than 65 on the exam.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>a. Let <m>X</m> = a score on the final exam. <m>X</m> ~ <m>N</m>(63, 5), where <m>μ</m> = 63 and <m>σ</m> = 5.</p>
          <p>Draw a graph.</p>
          <p>Calculate the <m>z</m>-score:</p>
          <p>The <m>z</m>-table shows that the area to the left of <m>z</m> is 0.6554. Subtracting this area from 1 gives 0.3446.</p>
          <p>Then, find <m>P</m>(<m>x</m> &gt; 65).</p>
          <p>The probability that any student selected at random scores more than 65 is 0.3446.</p>
          <p>Go into <c>2nd DISTR</c>.
<nbsp />After pressing <c>2nd DISTR</c>, press <c>2:normalcdf</c>.</p>
          <p>The syntax for the instructions is as follows:</p>
          <p>normalcdf(lower value, upper value, mean, standard deviation)
For this problem: normalcdf(65,1E99,63,5) = 0.3446. You get 1E99 (= 10^{99}) by pressing <c>1</c>, the <c>EE</c> keya 2nd keyand then <c>99</c>. Or, you can enter <c>10^99</c> instead. The number 10^{99} is way out in the right tail of the normal curve. We are calculating the area between 65 and 10^{99}. In some instances, the lower number of the area might be –1E99 (= –10^{99}). The number –10^{99} is way out in the left tail of the normal curve. We chose the exponent of 99 because this produces such a large number that we can reasonably expect all of the values under the curve to fall below it. This is an arbitrary value and one that works well, for our purpose.</p>
          <p>The TI probability program calculates a <m>z</m>-score and then the probability from the <m>z</m>-score. Before technology, the <m>z</m>-score was looked up in a standard normal probability table, also known as a Z-tablethe math involved to find probability is cumbersome. In this example, a standard normal table with area to the left of the <m>z</m>-score was used. You calculate the <m>z</m>-score and look up the area to the left. The probability is the area to the right.</p>

      <p>The normal distribution, which is continuous, is the most important of all the probability distributions. Its graph is bell-shaped. This bell-shaped curve is used in almost all disciplines. Since it is a continuous distribution, the total area under the curve is one. The parameters of the normal are the mean <m>µ</m> and the standard deviation <m>σ</m>. A special normal distribution, called the standard normal distribution, is the distribution of <m>z</m>-scores. Its mean is zero, and its standard deviation is one.</p>

      <statement>
        <p>A NUMMI assembly line, which has been operating since 1984, has built an average of 6,000 cars and trucks a week. Generally, 10 percent of the cars were defective coming off the assembly line. Suppose we draw a random sample of <m>n</m> = 100 cars. Let <m>X</m> represent the number of defective cars in the sample. What can we say about <m>X</m> in regard to  the 68–95–99.7 empirical ruleone standard deviation, two standard deviations, and three standard deviations from the mean being referred to?  Assume a normal distribution for the defective cars in the sample.</p>
