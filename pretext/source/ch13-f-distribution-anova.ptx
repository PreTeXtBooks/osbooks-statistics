      <title>Chapter Objectives</title>
      <p>By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interpret the <m>F</m> probability distribution as the number of groups and the sample size change</li>
        <li>Discuss two uses for the <m>F</m> distribution: one-way ANOVA and the test of two variances</li>
        <li>Conduct and interpret one-way ANOVA</li>
        <li>Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests of two variances</li>
      </ul>
    </note>
    <p>Many statistical applications in psychology, social science, business administration, and the natural sciences involve several groups. For example, an environmentalist is interested in knowing if the average amount of pollution varies among several bodies of water. A sociologist is interested in knowing if the amount of income a person earns varies according to his or her upbringing. A consumer looking for a new car might compare the average gas mileage of several models.</p>
    <p>For hypothesis tests comparing averages across more than two groups, statisticians have developed a method called <em>analysis of variance</em> (abbreviated ANOVA). In this chapter, you will study the simplest form of ANOVA called single factor or one-way ANOVA. You will also study the <m>F</m> distribution, used for one-way ANOVA, and the test of two variances. This is a very brief overview of one-way ANOVA. You will study this topic in much greater detail in future statistics courses. One-way ANOVA, as it is presented here, relies heavily on a calculator or computer.</p>

    <title>One-Way ANOVA</title>


    <subsection xml:id="ch13-m79703-fs-id1164565456340">
      <p>The purpose of a one-way ANOVA test is to determine the existence of a statistically significant difference among several group means. The test uses <term>variances</term> to help determine if the means are equal or not. To perform a one-way ANOVA test, there are five basic assumptions to be fulfilled:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each population from which a sample is taken is assumed to be normal.</li>
        <li>All samples are randomly selected and independent.</li>
        <li>The populations are assumed to have equal standard deviations (or variances).</li>
        <li>The factor is a categorical variable.</li>
        <li>The response is a numerical variable.</li>
      </ul>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="ch13-m79703-fs-idm3483088">
      <title>The Null and Alternative Hypotheses</title>
      <p>The null hypothesis is that all the group population means are the same. The alternative hypothesis is that at least one pair of means is different. For example, if there are <m>k</m> groups</p>
      <p><em>H_{0}</em>: <m>μ</m>_{1} = <m>μ</m>_{2} = <m>μ</m>_{3} = ... = <em>μ_{k}</em></p>
      <p><em>H_{a}</em>: At least two of the group means <m>μ</m>_{1}, <m>μ</m>_{2}, <m>μ</m>_{3}, ..., <em>μ_{k}</em> are not equal. That is, <em>μ_{i}</em> ≠ <em>μ_{j}</em> for some <m>i</m> ≠ <m>j</m>.</p>
      <p>The graphs, a set of box plots representing the distribution of values with the group means indicated by a horizontal line through the box, help in the understanding of the hypothesis test. In the first graph (red box plots), <em>H_{0}</em>: <em>μ_{1}</em> = <em>μ_{2}</em> = <em>μ_{3}</em> and the three populations have the same distribution if the null hypothesis is true. The variance of the combined data is approximately the same as the variance of each of the populations.</p>
      <p>If the null hypothesis is false, then the variance of the combined data is larger, which is caused by the different means as shown in the second graph (green box plots).</p>
      <figure xml:id="ch13-m79703-fs-idp110803872">
        <caption>(a) We fail to reject <em>H_{0}</em> as it may be true. All the means are about the same; the differences may be due to random variation. (b) We reject <em>H_{0}</em> as all the means are not the same; the differences are too large to be due to random variation.</caption>

      <title>Chapter Review</title>
      <p>Analysis of variance extends the comparison of two groups to several, each a level of a categorical variable (factor). Samples from each group are independent and must be randomly selected from normal populations with equal variances. We test the null hypothesis of equal means of the response in every group versus the alternative hypothesis of one or more group means being different from the others. A one-way ANOVA hypothesis test determines if several population means are equal. The distribution for the test is the <m>F</m> distribution with two different degrees of freedom.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each population from which a sample is taken is assumed to be normal.</li>
        <li>All samples are randomly selected and independent.</li>

    <title>The F Distribution and the F Ratio</title>


    <subsection xml:id="ch13-m79704-fs-id1164562208836">
      <p>The distribution used for the hypothesis test is a new one. It is called the <term><m>F</m> distribution</term>, named after Sir Ronald Fisher, an English statistician. The <m>F</m> statistic is a ratio (a fraction). There are two sets of degrees of freedom: one for the numerator and one for the denominator.</p>
      <p>For example, if <m>F</m> follows an <m>F</m> distribution and the number of degrees of freedom for the numerator is 4, and the number of degrees of freedom for the denominator is 10, then <m>F</m> ~ <em>F_{4,10}</em>.</p>
      <note xml:id="ch13-m79704-eip-261">
        <title>Note</title>
        <p>The <m>F</m> distribution is derived from the Student’s <m>t</m>-distribution. The values of the <m>F</m> distribution are squares of the corresponding values of the <m>t</m>-distribution. One-way ANOVA expands the <m>t</m>-test for comparing more than two groups. The scope of that derivation is beyond the level of this course. It is preferable to use ANOVA when there are more than two groups instead of performing pairwise <m>t</m>-tests because performing multiple tests introduces the likelihood of making a Type 1 error.</p>
      </note>
      <p>To calculate the <term><m>F</m> ratio</term>, two estimates of the variance are made.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Variance between samples: an estimate of <m>σ</m>^{2} that is the variance of the sample means multiplied by <m>n</m>, when the sample sizes are the same. If the samples are different sizes, the variance between samples is weighted to account for the different sample sizes. The variance is also called <em>variation due to treatment</em> or <em>explained variation.</em></li>
        <li>Variance within samples: an estimate of <m>σ</m>^{2} that is the average of the sample variances, also known as a <em>pooled variance</em>. When the sample sizes are different, the variance within samples is weighted. The variance is also called the <em>variation due to error</em> or <em>unexplained variation.</em></li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li><m>SS</m>_{between} = the sum of squares that represents the variation among the different samples</li>
        <li><m>SS</m>_{within} = the sum of squares that represents the variation within samples that is due to chance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To find a <em>sum of squares</em> mean, add together squared quantities which, in some
cases, may be weighted. We used sum of squares to calculate the sample variance and the sample standard deviation in <xref ref="ch02-descriptive-statistics">Descriptive Statistics</xref>.</p>
      <p><m>MS</m> means <em>mean square</em>. <m>MS</m>_{between} is the variance between groups, and <m>MS</m>_{within} is the variance within groups.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><m>k</m> = the number of different groups</li>
        <li><em>n_{j}</em> = the size of the <em>j^{th}</em> group</li>
        <li><em>s_{j}</em> = the sum of the values in the <em>j^{th}</em> group</li>
        <li><m>n</m> = total number of all the values combined (total sample size: ∑<em>n_{j}</em>)</li>
        <li><m>x</m> = one value: ∑<m>x</m> = ∑<em>s_{j}</em></li>
        <li>Sum of squares of all values from every group combined: ∑<m>x</m>^{2}</li>
        <li>Between group variability: <m>SS</m>_{total} = ∑<m>x</m>^{2} –  <m>\frac{(∑x^{2})}{n}</m></li>
        <li>Total sum of squares: ∑<m>x</m>^{2} –  <m>\frac{(∑x)^{2}}{n}</m></li>
        <li>Explained variation: sum of squares representing variation among the different samples
<m>SS_{(\text{between})}=∑[\frac{(s_{j})^{2}}{n_{j}}]-\frac{(∑s_{j})^{2}}{n}</m></li>
        <li>Unexplained variation: sum of squares representing variation within samples due to chance  <m>SS_{\text{within}}=SS_{\text{total}}-SS_{\text{between}}</m></li>
        <li><m>df</m>s for different groups (<m>df</m>s for the numerator): <m>df</m> = <m>k</m> – 1</li>
        <li>Equation for errors within samples (<m>df</m>s for the denominator): <m>df</m>_{within} = <m>n</m> – <m>k</m></li>
        <li>Mean square (variance estimate) explained by the different groups: <m>MS</m>_{between} =  <m>\frac{SS_{\text{between}}}{df_{\text{between}}}</m></li>
        <li>Mean square (variance estimate) that is due to chance (unexplained): <m>MS</m>_{within} =  <m>\frac{SS_{\text{within}}}{df_{\text{within}}}</m></li>
      </ul>
      <p><m>MS</m>_{between} and <m>MS</m>_{within} can be written as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><m>MS_{\text{between}}=\frac{SS_{\text{between}}}{df_{\text{between}}}=\frac{SS_{\text{between}}}{k-1}</m></li>
        <li><m>MS_{within}=\frac{SS_{within}}{df_{within}}=\frac{SS_{within}}{n-k}</m></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The one-way ANOVA test depends on the fact that <m>MS</m>_{between} can be influenced by population differences among means of the several groups. Since <m>MS</m>_{within} compares values of each group to its own group mean, the fact that group means might be different does not affect <m>MS</m>_{within}.</p>
      <p>The null hypothesis says that all groups are samples from populations having the same normal distribution. The alternate hypothesis says that at least two of the sample groups come from populations with different normal distributions. If the null hypothesis is true, <m>MS</m>_{between} and <m>MS</m>_{within} should both estimate the same value.</p>
      <note xml:id="ch13-m79704-eip-82">
        <title>Note</title>
        <p>The null hypothesis says that all the group population means are equal. The hypothesis of equal means implies that the populations have the same normal distribution because it is assumed that the populations are normal and that they have equal variances.</p>
      </note>
      <p><m>F</m> Ratio or <m>F</m> Statistic
 <m>F=\frac{MS_{\text{between}}}{MS_{\text{within}}}</m></p>
      <p>If <m>MS</m>_{between} and <m>MS</m>_{within} estimate the same value, following the belief that <em>H_{0}</em> is true, then the <m>F</m> ratio should be approximately equal to 1. Mostly, just sampling errors would contribute to variations away from 1. As it turns out, <m>MS</m>_{between} consists of the population variance plus a variance produced from the differences between the samples. <m>MS</m>_{within} is an estimate of the population variance. Since variances are always positive, if the null hypothesis is false, <m>MS</m>_{between} will generally be larger than <m>MS</m>_{within}. Then the <m>F</m> ratio will be larger than 1. However, if the population effect is small, it is not unlikely that <m>MS</m>_{within} will be larger in a given sample.</p>
      <p>The previous calculations were done with groups of different sizes. If the groups are the same size, the calculations simplify somewhat and the <m>F</m> ratio can be written as  follows:</p>
      <p><m>F</m> Ratio formula when the groups are the same size<m>F=\frac{n⋅s_{x¯}^{2}}{s^{2}_{\text{pooled}}}</m></p>
      <ul>
        <li><m>n</m> = the sample size</li>
        <li><m>df</m>_{numerator} = <m>k</m> – 1</li>
        <li><m>df</m>_{denominator} = <m>n</m> – <m>k</m></li>
        <li><m>s</m>^{2} pooled = the mean of the sample variances (pooled variance)</li>
        <li><m>s_{x¯}^{2}</m>  = the variance of the sample means</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Data is typically put into a table for easy viewing. One-way ANOVA results are often displayed in this manner by computer software.</p>

The ratio of these two is the <m>F</m> statistic from an <m>F</m> distribution with (number of groups – 1) as the numerator degrees of freedom and (number of observations – number of groups) as the denominator degrees of freedom. These statistics are summarized in the ANOVA table.</p>

          <p>Let’s return to the slicing tomato exercise in <xref ref="sec-f-distribution"/>. The means of the tomato yields under the five mulching conditions are represented by <m>μ</m>_{1}, <m>μ</m>_{2}, <m>μ</m>_{3}, <m>μ</m>_{4}, <m>μ</m>_{5}. We will conduct a hypothesis test to determine if all means are the same or at least one is different. Using a significance level of 5 percent, test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean yields among the five groups against the alternative hypothesis that at least one mean is different from the rest.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>The null and alternative hypotheses are  as follows:</p>
          <p><em>H_{0}</em>: <em>μ_{1}</em> = <em>μ_{2}</em> = <em>μ_{3}</em> = <em>μ_{4}</em> = <em>μ_{5}</em></p>

          <p>Make a decision: Since <m>α</m> &gt; <m>p</m>-value, we reject <em>H_{0}</em>.</p>
          <p>Conclusion: At the 5 percent significance level, we have reasonably strong evidence that differences in mean yields for slicing tomato plants grown under different mulching conditions are unlikely to be due to chance alone. We may conclude that at least some of the mulches led to different mean yields.</p>

          <p>This is an example of a <em>balanced design</em>, because each factor (i.e., sorority) has the same number of observations.</p>

          <p>With a <m>p</m>-value of 0.9271, we do not reject the null hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a difference among the GPAs for the sports teams.</p>

      <example xml:id="ch13-m79705-element-349">
        <statement>
          <p>Does it appear that the three soils in which the bean plants were grown produce the same mean height? Test at a 3 percent level of significance.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>This time, we will perform the calculations that lead to the <m>F'</m> statistic. Notice that each group has the same number of plants, so we will use the formula <m>F'</m> =   <m>\frac{n⋅s_{x¯}^{2}}{s^{2}_{\text{pooled}}}</m>  .</p>
          <p>First, calculate the sample mean and sample variance of each group.</p>
          <p>Next, calculate the variance of the three group means by calculating the variance of 24.2, 25.4, and 24.4. Variance of the group means = 0.413 =   <m>s_{x¯}^{2}</m>,</p>
          <p>then <em>MS_{between}</em> =   <m>ns_{x¯}^{2}</m>   = (5)(0.413) where <m>n</m> = 5 is the sample size (number of plants each child grew).</p>
          <p>Calculate the mean of the three sample variances (11.7, 18.3, and 16.3). Mean of the sample variances = 15.433 = <m>s</m>^{2}_{pooled},</p>
          <p>then <em>MS_{within}</em> = <m>s</m>^{2}_{<em>pooled</em>} = 15.433.</p>
          <p>The <m>F</m> statistic (or <m>F</m> ratio) is   <m>F=\frac{MS_{\text{between}}}{MS_{\text{within}}}=\frac{ns_{x¯}^{2}}{s^{2}_{pooled}}=\frac{(5)(0.413)}{15.433}=0.134\text{.}</m></p>
          <p>The <m>df</m>s for the numerator = the number of groups – 1 = 3 – 1 = 2.</p>
          <p>The <m>df</m>s for the denominator = the total number of samples – the number of groups = 15 – 3 = 12.</p>
          <p>The distribution for the test is <m>F</m>_{2,12} and the <m>F</m> statistic is <m>F</m> = 0.134.</p>
          <p>The <m>p</m>-value is <m>P</m>(<m>F</m> &gt; 0.134) = 0.8759.</p>
          <p>Decision: Since <m>α</m> = 0.03 and the <m>p</m>-value = 0.8759, we do not reject <em>H_{0}</em>. Why?</p>
          <p>Conclusion: With a 3 percent level of significance from the sample data, the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that the mean heights of the bean plants are  different.</p>

      <title>Chapter Review</title>
      <p>The graph of the <m>F</m> distribution is always positive and skewed right, though the shape can be mounded or exponential depending on the combination of numerator and denominator degrees of freedom. The <m>F</m> statistic is the ratio of a measure of the variation in the group means to a similar measure of the variation within the groups. If the null hypothesis is correct, then the numerator should be small compared to the denominator. A small <m>F</m> statistic will result, and the area under the <m>F</m> curve to the right will be large, representing a large <m>p</m>-value. When the null hypothesis of equal group means is incorrect, then the numerator should be large compared to the denominator, giving a large <m>F</m> statistic and a small area (small <m>p</m>-value) to the right of the statistic under the <m>F</m> curve.</p>
      <p>When the data have unequal group sizes (unbalanced data), then techniques from <xref ref="sec-f-distribution">The F Distribution and the F Ratio</xref> need to be used for hand calculations. In the case of balanced data, where the groups are the same size, simplified calculations based on group means and variances may be used. In practice, software is usually employed in the analysis. As in any analysis, graphs of various sorts should be used in conjunction with numerical techniques. Always look at your data!</p>

          <p>DDT is a pesticide that has been banned from use in the United States and most other areas of the world. It is quite effective but persisted in the environment and over time proved to be harmful to higher-level organisms. Famously, egg shells of eagles and other raptors were believed to be thinner and prone to breakage in the nest because of ingestion of DDT in the food chain of the birds.</p>
          <p>An experiment was conducted on the number of eggs (fecundity) laid by female fruit flies. There are three groups of flies. One group was bred to be resistant to DDT (the RS group).

Using a 1 percent level of significance, are the mean rates of egg selection for the three strains of fruit fly different?  If so, in what way?  Specifically, the researchers were interested in whether the selectively bred strains were different from the nonselected line, and whether the two selected lines were different from each other.</p>

          <p>Interestingly, if you perform a two sample <m>t</m> test to compare the RS and NS groups they are significantly different (<m>p</m> = 0.0013). Similarly, SS and NS are significantly different (<m>p</m> = 0.0006). However, the two selected groups, RS and SS are <em>not</em> significantly different (<m>p</m> = 0.5176). Thus we appear to have good evidence that selection either for resistance or for susceptibility involves a reduced rate of egg production (for these specific strains) as compared to flies that were not selected for resistance or susceptibility to DDT. Here, genetic selection has apparently involved a loss of fecundity.</p>

    <title>Test of Two Variances</title>


    <subsection xml:id="ch13-m79706-fs-id1164563512922">
      <p>Another use of the <m>F</m> distribution is testing two variances. It is often desirable to compare two variances rather than two averages. For instance, college administrators would like two college professors grading exams to have the same variation in their grading. For a lid to fit a container, the variation in the lid and the container should be the same. A supermarket might be interested in the variability of check-out times for two checkers.</p>
      <p>To perform a <m>F</m> test of two variances, it is important that the following are true:

The populations from which the two samples are drawn are normally distributed.
The two populations are independent of each other.</p>
      <p>Unlike most other tests in this book, the <m>F</m> test for equality of two variances is very sensitive to deviations from normality. If the two distributions are not normal, the test can give higher <m>p</m>-values than it should, or lower ones, in ways that are unpredictable. Many texts suggest that students not use this test at all, but in the interest of completeness we include it here.</p>
      <p>Suppose we sample randomly from two independent normal populations. Let <m>\sigma12</m> and <m>\sigma22</m> be the population variances and <m>s12</m> and <m>s22</m> be the sample variances. Let the
sample sizes be <m>n</m>_{1} and <m>n</m>_{2}. Since we are interested in comparing the two sample variances, we use the <m>F</m> ratio</p>
      <p><m>F=\frac{[\frac{(s_{1})^{2}}{(\sigma_{1})^{2}}]}{[\frac{(s_{2})^{2}}{(\sigma_{2})^{2}}]}.</m></p>
      <p><m>F</m> has the distribution <m>F</m> ~ <m>F</m>(<m>n</m>_{1} – 1, <m>n</m>_{2} – 1),</p>
      <p>where <m>n</m>_{1} – 1 are the degrees of freedom for the numerator and <m>n</m>_{2} – 1 are the degrees of freedom for the denominator.</p>
      <p>If the null hypothesis is <m>\sigma12=\sigma22</m>, then the <m>F</m> ratio becomes <m>F=\frac{[\frac{(s_{1})^{2}}{(\sigma_{1})^{2}}]}{[\frac{(s_{2})^{2}}{(\sigma_{2})^{2}}]}=\frac{(s_{1})^{2}}{(s_{2})^{2}}</m>.</p>
      <note xml:id="ch13-m79706-eip-545">
        <title>Note</title>
        <p>The <m>F</m> ratio could also be <m>\frac{(s_{2})^{2}}{(s_{1})^{2}}</m>.

 It depends on <em>H_{a}</em> and on which sample variance is larger.</p>
      </note>
      <p>If the two populations have equal variances, then <m>s12</m> and <m>s22</m> are close in value and <m>F=\frac{(s_{1})^{2}}{(s_{2})^{2}}</m> is close to 1. But if the two population variances are very different, <m>s12</m> and <m>s22</m> tend to be very different, too. Choosing <m>s12</m> as the larger sample variance causes the ratio <m>\frac{(s_{1})^{2}}{(s_{2})^{2}}</m> to be greater than 1. If <m>s12</m> and <m>s22</m> are far apart, then <m>F=\frac{(s_{1})^{2}}{(s_{2})^{2}}</m> is a large number.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if <m>F</m> is close to 1, the evidence favors the null hypothesis (the two population variances are equal). But if <m>F</m> is much larger than 1, then the evidence is against the null hypothesis. A test of two variances may be left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed.</p>
      <example xml:id="ch13-m79706-element-315">
        <statement>
          <p>Two college instructors are interested in whethe there is any variation in the way they grade math exams. They each grade the same set of 30 exams. The first instructor’s grades have a variance of 52.3. The second instructor’s grades have a variance of 89.9. Test the claim that the first instructor’s variance is smaller. In most colleges, it is desirable for the variances of exam grades to be nearly the same among instructors. The level of significance is 10 percent.</p>

          <p>The New York Choral Society divides male singers into four categories from highest voices to lowest: Tenor1, Tenor2, Bass1, and Bass2. In the table are heights of the men in the Tenor1 and Bass2 groups. One suspects that taller men will have lower voices, and that the variance of height may go up with the lower voices as well.

      <p>The <m>F</m> test for the equality of two variances rests heavily on the assumption of normal distributions. The test is unreliable if this assumption is not met. If both distributions are normal, then the ratio of the two sample variances is distributed as an <m>F</m> statistic, with numerator and denominator degrees of freedom that are one less than the samples sizes of the corresponding two groups. A <em>test of two variances</em> hypothesis test determines if two variances are the same. The distribution for the hypothesis test is the <m>F</m> distribution with two different degrees of freedom.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The populations from which the two samples are drawn are normally distributed.</li>
        <li>The two populations are independent of each other.</li>

          <p><m>P</m>(<m>F</m> &gt; 26.272) = 0.</p>
          <p>Reject the null hypothesis for any alpha. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean silver content among the four coinages are different. From the strip chart, it appears that the first and second coinages had higher silver contents than the third and fourth.</p>

        <statement>
          <p>The American League and the National League of Major League Baseball are each divided into three divisions: East, Central, and West. Many years, fans talk about some divisions being stronger (having better teams) than other divisions. This may have consequences for the postseason. For instance, in 2012 Tampa Bay won 90 games and did not play in the postseason, while Detroit won only 88 and did play in the postseason. This may have been an oddity, but is there good evidence that in the 2012 season, the American League divisions were significantly different in overall records? Use the following data to test whether the mean number of wins per team in the three American League divisions were the same. Note that the data are not balanced, as two divisions had five teams, while one had only four.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Here is a stripchart of the number of wins for the 14 teams in the AL for the 2012 season.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>While the spread seems similar, there may be some question about the normality of the data, given the wide gaps in the middle near the 0.500 mark of 82 games (teams play 162 games each season in MLB). However, one-way ANOVA is robust.</p>
          <p>Here is the ANOVA table for the data:</p>
          <p><m>P</m>(<m>F</m> &gt; 1.5521) = 0.2548
<nbsp/>Since the <m>p</m>-value is so large, there is not good evidence against the null hypothesis of equal means. We decline to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, for 2012, there is not any good evidence of a significant difference in mean number of wins between the divisions of the American League.</p>

      <title>analysis of variance</title>
      <p>also referred to as ANOVA; a method of testing whether the means of three or more populations are equal. The method is applicable if: all populations of interest are normally distributed, the populations have equal standard deviations, and samples (not necessarily of the same size) are randomly and independently selected from each population. The test statistic for analysis of variance is the F ratio.</p>
