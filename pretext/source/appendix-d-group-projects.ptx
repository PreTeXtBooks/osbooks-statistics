 ____ <em>State how you will collect your data.</em> (Convenience sampling is not acceptable.) 
 ____ <em>Conduct your survey. You must have more than 50 responses in your sample.</em> When you hand in your final project, attach the tally sheet or the packet of questionnaires that you used to collect data. Your data must be real. 
 ____ <em>State the statistics</em> that are a result of your data collection: sample size, sample mean, and sample standard deviation, OR sample size and number of successes. 
 ____ <em>Make two copies of the appropriate solution sheet.</em> 
 ____ <em>Record the hypothesis test</em> on the solution sheet, based on your experiment. <em>Do a DRAFT solution</em> first on one of the solution sheets and check it over carefully.

Show your work and calculations as to how you used the potential outlier formula in <xref ref="ch02-descriptive-statistics">Descriptive Statistics</xref> (since you are now using univariate data) to determine which values might be outliers. 
 _____Construct a box plot of your data. 
 _____Does the middle 50% of your data appear to be concentrated together or spread out? Explain how you determined this. 
 _____Looking at both the histogram AND the box plot, discuss the distribution of your data.    For example: how does the spread of the middle 50% of your data compare to the spread of the rest of the data represented in the box plot; how does this correspond to your description of the shape of the histogram; how does the graphical display show any outliers you may have found; does the histogram show any gaps in the data that are not visible in the box plot; are there any interesting features of your data that you should point out.
