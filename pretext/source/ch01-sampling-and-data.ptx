      <title>Chapter Objectives</title>
      <p>By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognize and differentiate between key terms</li>
        <li>Apply various types of sampling methods to data collection</li>
        <li>Create and interpret frequency tables</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>

    <p>You are probably asking yourself the question, <q>When and where will I use statistics?</q> If you read any newspaper, watch television, or use the Internet, you will see statistical information. There are statistics about crime, sports, education, politics, and real estate. Typically, when you read a newspaper article or watch a television news program, you are given sample information. With this information, you may make a decision about the correctness of a statement, claim, or <em>fact</em>. Statistical methods can help you make the <em>best educated guess</em>.</p>

    <p>Since you will undoubtedly be given statistical information at some point in your life, you need to know some techniques for analyzing the information thoughtfully. Think about buying a house or managing a budget. Think about your chosen profession. The fields of economics, business, psychology, education, biology, law, computer science, police science, and early childhood development require at least one course in statistics.</p>

    <p>Included in this chapter are the basic ideas and words of probability and statistics. You will soon understand that statistics and probability work together. You will also learn how data are gathered and what <em>good</em> data can be distinguished from <em>bad</em>.</p>

    <title>Definitions of Statistics, Probability, and Key Terms</title>
    <p xml:id="id8112751">The science of <term xml:id="term-00001">statistics</term> deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of <term xml:id="term-00002">data</term>. We see and use data in our everyday lives. </p>
    <exploration xml:id="fs-idm27544368">
      <p xml:id="eip-34">In your classroom, try this exercise. Have class members write down the average time—in hours, to the nearest half-hour—they sleep per night. Your instructor will record the data. Then create a simple graph, called a dot plot, of the data. A dot plot consists of a number line and dots, or points, positioned above the number line. For example, consider the following data:</p>
      <p xml:id="eip-idm80945824">5, 5.5, 6, 6, 6, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9.</p>
      <p xml:id="eip-71">The dot plot for this data would be as follows:</p>
      <figure xml:id="eip-idp25549888">
        <image source="media/fig-ch01_02_01n.png">
        </image>
      </figure>
      <p xml:id="id10326643">Does your dot plot look the same as or different from the example? Why? If you did the same example in an English class with the same number of students, do you think the results would be the same? Why or why not?</p>
      <p xml:id="id9336363">Where do your data appear to cluster? How might you interpret the clustering?</p>
      <p xml:id="id9969457">The questions above ask you to analyze and interpret your data. With this example, you have begun your study of statistics.</p>
    </exploration>
    <p xml:id="eip-624">In this course, you will learn how to organize and summarize data. Organizing and summarizing data is called <term xml:id="term-00003">descriptive statistics</term>. Two ways to summarize data are by graphing and by using numbers, for example, finding an average. After you have studied probability and probability distributions, you will use formal methods for drawing conclusions from <em>good</em> data. The formal methods are called <term xml:id="term-00004">inferential statistics</term>. Statistical inference uses probability to determine how confident we can be that our conclusions are correct.</p>
    <p xml:id="eip-23">Effective interpretation of data, or inference, is based on good procedures for producing data and thoughtful examination of the data. You will encounter what will seem to be too many mathematical formulas for interpreting data. The goal of statistics is not to perform numerous calculations using the formulas, but to gain an understanding of your data. The calculations can be done using a calculator or a computer. The understanding must come from you. If you can thoroughly grasp the basics of statistics, you can be more confident in the decisions you make in life.</p>
    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1170309364460">
      <title>Statistical Models</title>
      <p xml:id="fs-id1170309782312">Statistics, like all other branches of mathematics, uses <term xml:id="term-00005">mathematical models</term> to describe phenomena that occur in the real world. Some mathematical models are deterministic. These models can be used when one value is precisely determined from another value. Examples of deterministic models are the quadratic equations that describe the acceleration of a car from rest or the differential equations that describe the transfer of heat from a stove to a pot. These models are quite accurate and can be used to answer questions and make predictions with a high degree of precision. Space agencies, for example, use deterministic models to predict the exact amount of thrust that a rocket needs to break away from Earths gravity and achieve orbit.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-id1170309244576">However, life is not always precise. While scientists can predict to the minute the time that the sun will rise, they cannot say precisely where a hurricane will make landfall. <alert>Statistical models</alert> can be used to predict lifes more uncertain situations. These special forms of mathematical models or functions are based on the idea that one value affects another value. Some statistical models are mathematical functions that are more preciseone set of values can predict or determine another set of values. Or some statistical models are mathematical functions in which a set of values do not precisely determine other values. Statistical models are very useful because they can describe the probability or likelihood of an event occurring and provide alternative outcomes if the event does not occur. For example, weather forecasts are examples of statistical models. Meteorologists cannot predict tomorrows weather with certainty. However, they often use statistical models to tell you how likely it is to rain at any given time, and you can prepare yourself based on this probability.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="eip-177">
      <title>Probability</title>
      <p xml:id="fs-idm37641920"><term xml:id="term-00006">Probability</term> is a mathematical tool used to study randomness. It deals with the chance of an event occurring. For example, if you toss a <em>fair</em> coin four times, the outcomes may not be two heads and two tails. However, if you toss the same coin 4,000 times, the outcomes will be close to half heads and half tails. The expected theoretical probability of heads in any one toss is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> or .5. Even though the outcomes of a few repetitions are uncertain, there is a regular pattern of outcomes when there are many repetitions. After reading about the English statistician Karl <term xml:id="term-00007">Pearson</term> who tossed a coin 24,000 times with a result of 12,012 heads, one of the authors tossed a coin 2,000 times. The results were 996 heads. The fraction <m>\frac{996}{2,000}</m> is equal to .498 which is very close to .5, the expected probability.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idm51841168">The theory of probability began with the study of games of chance such as poker. Predictions take the form of probabilities. To predict the likelihood of an earthquake, of rain, or whether you will get an <em>A</em> in this course, we use probabilities. Doctors use probability to determine the chance of a vaccination causing the disease the vaccination is supposed to prevent. A stockbroker uses probability to determine the rate of return on a client's investments.</p>

      <title>Key Terms</title>
      <p xml:id="fs-idm63797184">In statistics, we generally want to study a <term xml:id="term-00008">population</term>. You can think of a population as a collection of persons, things, or objects under study. To study the population, we select a <term xml:id="term-00009">sample</term>. The idea of <term xml:id="term-00010">sampling</term> is to select a portion, or subset, of the larger population and study that portion—the sample—to gain information about the population. Data are the result of sampling from a population.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp7610128">Because it takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population, sampling is a very practical technique. If you wished to compute the overall grade point average at your school, it would make sense to select a sample of students who attend the school. The data collected from the sample would be the students' grade point averages. In presidential elections, opinion poll samples of 1,000–2,000 people are taken. The opinion poll is supposed to represent the views of the people in the entire country. Manufacturers of canned carbonated drinks take samples to determine if a 16-ounce can contains 16 ounces of carbonated drink.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idm52897344">From the sample data, we can calculate a statistic. A <alert>statistic</alert> is a number that represents a property of the sample. For example, if we consider one math class as a sample of the population of <em>all</em> math classes, then the average number of points earned by students in that one math class at the end of the term is an example of a statistic. Since we do not have the data for all math classes, that statistic is our best estimate of the average for the entire population of math classes. If we happen to have data for <em>all</em> math classes, we can find the population parameter. A <alert>parameter</alert> is a numerical characteristic of the whole population that can be estimated by a statistic. Since we considered all math classes to be the population, then the average number of points earned per student over all the math classes is an example of a parameter.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idm69156368">One of the main concerns in the field of statistics is how accurately a statistic estimates a parameter. In order to have an accurate sample, it must contain the characteristics of the population in order to be a <term xml:id="term-00011">representative sample</term>. We are interested in both the sample statistic and the population parameter in inferential statistics. In a later chapter, we will use the sample statistic to test the validity of the established population parameter.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idm62450928">A <term xml:id="term-00012">variable</term>, usually notated by capital letters such as <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, is a characteristic or measurement that can be determined for each member of a population. Variables may describe values like weight in pounds or favorite subject in school. <term xml:id="term-00013">Numerical variables</term> take on values with equal units such as weight in pounds and time in hours. <term xml:id="term-00014">Categorical variables</term> place the person or thing into a category. If we let <em>X</em> equal the number of points earned by one math student at the end of a term, then <em>X</em> is a numerical variable. If we let <em>Y</em> be a person's party affiliation, then some examples of <em>Y</em> include Republican, Democrat, and Independent. <em>Y</em> is a categorical variable. We could do some math with values of <em>X</em>—calculate the average number of points earned, for example—but it makes no sense to do math with values of <em>Y</em>—calculating an average party affiliation makes no sense.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idm69507040"><term xml:id="term-00015">Data</term> are the actual values of the variable. They may be numbers or they may be words. <em>Datum</em> is a single value.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idm150607232">Two words that come up often in statistics are <term xml:id="term-00016">mean</term> and <term xml:id="term-00017">proportion</term>. If you were to take three exams in your math classes and obtain scores of 86, 75, and 92, you would calculate your mean score by adding the three exam scores and dividing by three. Your mean score would be 84.3 to one decimal place. If, in your math class, there are 40 students and 22 are males and 18 females, then the proportion of men students is <m>\frac{22}{40}</m> and the proportion of women students is <m>\frac{18}{40}</m>. Mean and proportion are discussed in more detail in later chapters.</p>

    <title>Data, Sampling, and Variation in Data and Sampling</title>
    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164564371802">
      <p xml:id="id7862377">Data may come from a population or from a sample. Lowercase letters like <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> generally are used to represent data values. Most data can be put into the following categories:</p>
      <ul xml:id="id10607985">
        <li>Qualitative</li>
        <li>Quantitative</li>
      </ul>
      <p xml:id="id9602938"><term xml:id="term-00001">Qualitative data</term> are the result of categorizing or describing attributes of a population. Qualitative data are also often called <term xml:id="term-00002">categorical data</term>. Hair color, blood type, ethnic group, the car a person drives, and the street a person lives on are examples of qualitative data. Qualitative data are generally described by words or letters. For instance, hair color might be black, dark brown, light brown, blonde, gray, or red. Blood type might be AB+, O–, or B+. Researchers often prefer to use quantitative data over qualitative data because it lends itself more easily to mathematical analysis. For example, it does not make sense to find an average hair color or blood type.</p>
      <p xml:id="id3365343"><term xml:id="term-00003">Quantitative data</term> are always numbers. Quantitative data are the result of <em>counting</em> or <em>measuring</em> attributes of a population. Amount of money, pulse rate, weight, number of people living in your town, and number of students who take statistics are examples of quantitative data. Quantitative data may be either <term xml:id="term-00004">discrete</term> or <term xml:id="term-00005">continuous</term>.</p>
      <p xml:id="id9750754">All data that are the result of counting are called <term xml:id="term-00006">quantitative discrete data</term>. These data take on only certain numerical values. If you count the number of phone calls you receive for each day of the week, you might get values such as zero, one, two, or three.</p>
      <p xml:id="id5023881">Data that are not only made up of counting numbers, but that may include fractions, decimals, or irrational numbers, are called <term xml:id="term-00007">quantitative continuous data</term>. Continuous data are often  the results of measurements like lengths, weights, or times. A list of the lengths in minutes for all the phone calls that you make in a week, with numbers like 2.4, 7.5, or 11.0, would be quantitative continuous data.</p>

      <title>Qualitative Data Discussion</title>
      <p xml:id="eip-298">Below are tables comparing the number of part-time and full-time students at De Anza College and Foothill College enrolled for the spring 2010 quarter. The tables display counts, frequencies, and percentages or proportions, relative frequencies. For instance, to calculate the percentage of part time students at De Anza College, divide 9,200/22,496 to get .4089. Round to the nearest thousandth—third decimal place and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage, which is 40.9 percent.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-id1164563494537">So, the percent columns make comparing the same categories in the colleges easier. Displaying percentages along with the numbers is often helpful, but it is particularly important when comparing sets of data that do not have the same totals, such as the total enrollments for both colleges in this example. Notice how much larger the percentage for part-time students at Foothill College is compared to De Anza College.</p>

      <p xml:id="fs-id1170308283619">This is a two-way table because it displays information about two categorical variables, in this case, gender and sports. Data of this type (two variable data) are referred to as <em>bivariate data</em>. Because the data represent a count, or tally, of choices, it is a two-way <em>frequency</em> table. The entries in the total row and the total column represent marginal frequencies or <em>marginal distributions</em>. Note—The term marginal distributions gets its name from the fact that the distributions are found in the margins of frequency distribution tables. Marginal distributions may be given as a fraction or decimal: For example, the total for men could be given as .6 or 3/5 since <m>30/50 = .6 = 3/5.</m> Marginal distributions require bivariate data and only focus on <em>one</em> of the variables represented in the table. In other words, the reason 20 is a marginal frequency in this two-way table is because it represents the margin or portion of the total population that is women (20/50). The reason 25 is a marginal frequency is because it represents the portion of those sampled who favor football (25/50). Note: The values that make up the body of the table (e.g., 20, 8, 2) are called <em>joint frequencies</em>.</p>

      <title>Sampling</title>
      <p xml:id="id12361474">Gathering information about an entire population often costs too much or is virtually impossible. Instead, we use a sample of the population. <em>A sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing.</em> Most statisticians use various methods of random sampling in an attempt to achieve this goal. This section will describe a few of the most common methods. There are several different methods of <em>random sampling</em>. In each form of random sampling, each member of a population initially has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. Each method has pros and cons. The easiest method to describe is called a <em>simple random sample</em>. In a simple random sample, each group has the same chance of being selected. In other words, each sample of the same size has an equal chance of being selected. For example, suppose Lisa wants to form a four-person study group (herself and three other people) from her pre-calculus class, which has 31 members not including Lisa. To choose a simple random sample of size three from the other members of her class, Lisa could put all 31 names in a hat, shake the hat, close her eyes, and pick out three names. A more technological way is for Lisa to first list the last names of the members of her class together with a two-digit number, as in <xref ref=""></xref>.</p>

      </note>
      <p xml:id="id11076554">Besides simple random sampling, there are other forms of sampling that involve a chance process for getting the sample. <em>Other well-known random sampling methods are the stratified sample, the cluster sample, and the systematic sample.</em></p>
      <p xml:id="fs-id1164562246344">To choose a stratified sample, divide the population into groups called strata and then the sample is selected by picking the same number of values from each strata until the desired sample size is reached. For example, you could stratify (group) your high school student population by year (freshmen, sophomore, juniors, and seniors) and then choose a proportionate simple random sample from each stratum (each year) to get a stratified random sample. To choose a simple random sample from each year, number each student of the first year, number each student of the second year, and do the same for the remaining years. Then use simple random sampling to choose proportionate numbers of students from the first year and do the same for each of the remaining years. Those numbers picked from the first year, picked from the second year, and so on represent the students who make up the stratified sample.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-id1164566895148">To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into clusters (groups) and then randomly select some of the clusters. All the members from these clusters are in the cluster sample. For example, if you randomly sample four homeroom classes from your student population, the four classes make up the cluster sample. Each class is a cluster. Number each cluster, and then choose four different numbers using random sampling. All the students of the four classes with those numbers are the cluster sample. So, unlike a stratified example, a cluster sample may not contain an equal number of randomly chosen students from each class.</p>
      <p xml:id="para-00001">To choose a systematic sample, establish and follow a rule. The most common way to select a systematic sample is to list the members of the population and choose every <m>nth</m> entry from a random starting point. For example, suppose you have 100,000 individuals in your population and you want to choose a sample of 1,000. Use a random number generator to select your starting point. Now, 100,000/1,000 = 100, so to ensure coverage throughout the list, choose every <m>100th</m> entry in the list. When you reach the end of the list, continue the count from the beginning until you have selected the complete sample.</p>
      <p xml:id="id12385449">A type of sampling that is non-random is convenience sampling. <em>Convenience sampling</em> involves using results that are readily available. For example, a computer software store conducts a marketing study by interviewing potential customers who happen to be in the store browsing through the available software. The results of convenience sampling may be very good in some cases and highly biased (favor certain outcomes) in others.</p>
      <p xml:id="id10814456">Sampling data should be done very carefully. Collecting data carelessly can have devastating results. Surveys mailed to households and then returned may be very biased. They may favor a certain group. It is better for the person conducting the survey to select the sample respondents.</p>
      <p xml:id="id11715554">When you analyze data, it is important to be aware of <em>sampling errors</em> and nonsampling errors. The actual process of sampling causes sampling errors. For example, the sample may not be large enough. Factors not related to the sampling process cause <em>nonsampling errors</em>. A defective counting device can cause a nonsampling error.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp101680848">In reality, a sample will never be exactly representative of the population so there will always be some sampling error. As a rule, the larger the sample, the smaller the sampling error.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp40043264">In statistics, <em>a sampling bias</em> is created when a sample is collected from a population and some members of the population are not as likely to be chosen as others. Remember, each member of the population should have an equally likely chance of being chosen. When a sampling bias happens, there can be incorrect conclusions drawn about the population that is being studied. For instance, if a survey of all students is conducted only during noon lunchtime hours is biased. This is because the students who do not have a noon lunchtime would not be included.</p>

      <title>Critical Evaluation</title>
      <p xml:id="element-607">We need to evaluate the statistical studies we read about critically and analyze them before accepting the results of the studies. Common problems to be aware of include the following:</p>
      <ul xml:id="element-17">
        <li>Problems with samples: A sample must be representative of the population. A sample that is not representative of the population is biased. Biased samples that are not representative of the population give results that are inaccurate and not reliable. Reliability in statistical measures must also be considered when analyzing data. Reliability refers to the consistency of a measure. A measure is reliable when the same results are produced given the same circumstances.</li>
        <li>Self-selected samplesResponses only by people who choose to respond, such as internet surveys, are often unreliable.</li>
        <li>Sample size issues: Samples that are too small may be unreliable. Larger samples are better, if possible. In some situations, having small samples is unavoidable and can still be used to draw conclusions. Examples include crash testing cars or medical testing for rare conditions.</li>
        <li>Undue influence: collecting data or asking questions in a way that influences the response.</li>
        <li>Non-response or refusal of subject to participate: The collected responses may no longer be representative of the population.  Often, people with strong positive or negative opinions may answer surveys, which can affect the results.</li>
        <li>Causality: A relationship between two variables does not mean that one causes the other to occur. They may be related (correlated) because of their relationship through a different variable.</li>
        <li>Self-funded or self-interest studies: A study performed by a person or organization in order to support their claim. Is the study impartial? Read the study carefully to evaluate the work. Do not automatically assume that the study is good, but do not automatically assume the study is bad either. Evaluate it on its merits and the work done.</li>
        <li>Misleading use of data: These can be improperly displayed graphs, incomplete data, or lack of context.</li>

    Suppose ABC college has 10,000 upperclassman (junior and senior level) students (the population). We are interested in the average amount of money an upperclassmen spends on books in the fall term. Asking all 10,000 upperclassmen is an almost impossible task.</p>
        <p xml:id="element-199">Suppose we take two different samples. </p>
        <p xml:id="element-499">First, we use convenience sampling and survey ten upperclassman students from a first term organic chemistry class. Many of these students are taking first term calculus in addition to the organic chemistry class. The amount of money they spend on books is as follows:</p>

The second sample is a group of seniors who are, more than likely, taking courses for health and interest.

We assume that these are the only disciplines in which part-time students at ABC College are enrolled and that an equal number of part-time students are enrolled in each of the disciplines. Each student is chosen using simple random sampling. Using a calculator, random numbers are generated and a student from a particular discipline is selected if he or she has a corresponding number.

      <title>Variation in Data</title>
      <p xml:id="id8219993"><term xml:id="term-00008">Variation</term> is present in any set of data. For example, 16-ounce cans of beverage may contain more or less than 16 ounces of liquid. In one study, eight 16 ounce cans were measured and produced the following amount (in ounces) of beverage:</p>
      <p xml:id="element-25004">15.8, 16.1, 15.2, 14.8, 15.8, 15.9, 16.0, 15.5.</p>
      <p xml:id="id6856137">Measurements of the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can may vary because different people make the measurements or because the exact amount, 16 ounces of liquid, was not put into the cans. Manufacturers regularly run tests to determine if the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can falls within the desired range.</p>
      <p xml:id="id5172174">Be aware that as you take data, your data may vary somewhat from the data someone else is taking for the same purpose. This is completely natural. However, if two or more of you are taking the same data and get very different results, it is time for you and the others to reevaluate your data-taking methods and your accuracy.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="eip-735">
      <title>Variation in Samples</title>
      <p xml:id="id11414550">It was mentioned previously that two or more <term xml:id="term-00009">samples</term> from the same <term xml:id="term-00010">population</term>, taken randomly, and having close to the same characteristics of the population will likely be different from each other. Suppose Doreen and Jung both decide to study the average amount of time students at their high school sleep each night. Doreen and Jung each take samples of 500 students. Doreen uses systematic sampling and Jung uses cluster sampling. Doreen's sample will be different from Jung's sample. Even if Doreen and Jung used the same sampling method, in all likelihood their samples would be different. Neither would be wrong, however. </p>
      <p xml:id="id11414555">Think about what contributes to making Doreen’s and Jung’s samples different. </p>
      <p xml:id="id10715475">If Doreen and Jung took larger samples, that is, the number of data values is increased, their sample results (the average amount of time a student sleeps) might be closer to the actual population average. But still, their samples would be, in all likelihood, different from each other. This is called <em>sampling variability</em>. In other words,  it refers to how much a statistic varies from sample to sample within a population. The larger the sample size, the smaller the variability between samples will be. So, the large sample size makes for a better, more reliable statistic.</p>

        <title>Size of a Sample</title>
        <p xml:id="id10291271">The size of a sample (often called the number of observations) is important. The examples you have seen in this book so far have been small. Samples of only a few hundred observations, or even smaller, are sufficient for many purposes. In polling, samples that are from 1,200–1,500 observations are considered large enough and good enough if the survey is random and is well done. You will learn why when you study confidence intervals.</p>

        <statement>
          <p xml:id="eip-265">Several online textbook retailers advertise that they have lower prices than on-campus bookstores. However, an important factor is whether the Internet retailers actually have the textbooks that students need in stock. Students need to be able to get textbooks promptly at the beginning of the college term. If the book is not available, then a student would not be able to get the textbook at all, or might get a delayed delivery if the book is back ordered.</p>
          <p xml:id="eip-idm58143808">A college newspaper reporter is investigating textbook availability at online retailers. He decides to investigate one textbook for each of the following seven subjects: calculus, biology, chemistry, physics, statistics, geology, and general engineering. He consults textbook industry sales data and selects the most popular nationally used textbook in each of these subjects. He visits websites for a random sample of major online textbook sellers and looks up each of these seven textbooks to see if they are available in stock for quick delivery through these retailers. Based on his investigation, he writes an article in which he draws conclusions about the overall availability of all college textbooks through online textbook retailers.</p>
          <p xml:id="eip-idm84454800">Write an analysis of his study that addresses the following issues: Is his sample representative of the population of all college textbooks?  Explain why or why not. Describe some possible sources of bias in this study, and how it might affect the results of the study. Give some suggestions about what could be done to improve the study.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p xml:id="eip-idp37500272">Answers will vary. Sample answer: The sample is not representative of the population of all college textbooks. Two reasons why it is not representative are that he only sampled seven subjects and he only investigated one textbook in each subject. There are several possible sources of bias in the study. The seven subjects that he investigated are all in mathematics and the sciences; there are many subjects in the humanities, social sciences, and other subject areas, for example: literature, art, history, psychology, sociology, business, that he did not investigate at all. It may be that different subject areas exhibit different patterns of textbook availability, but his sample would not detect such results.</p>
          <p xml:id="eip-idp37501360">He also looked only at the most popular textbook in each of the subjects he investigated. The availability of the most popular textbooks may differ from the availability of other textbooks in one of two ways:</p>
          <ul xml:id="eip-id1168183078945">
            <li>The most popular textbooks may be more readily available online, because more new
    copies are printed, and more students nationwide are selling back their used copies</li>
            <li>The most popular textbooks may be harder to find available online, because more student demand exhausts the supply more quickly.</li>
          </ul>
          <p xml:id="eip-idm273136">In reality, many college students do not use the most popular textbook in their subject, and this study gives no useful information about the situation for those less popular textbooks.</p>
          <p xml:id="eip-idm272544">He could improve this study by</p>
          <ul xml:id="eip-id1169691864822">
            <li>expanding the selection of subjects he investigates so that it is more representative of all subjects studied by college students, and</li>
            <li>expanding the selection of textbooks he investigates within each subject to include a
    mixed representation of both the most popular and less popular textbooks.</li>

      <title>Levels of Measurement</title>
      <p xml:id="eip-192">The way a set of data is measured is called its <term xml:id="term-00001">level of measurement</term>. Correct statistical procedures depend on a researcher being familiar with levels of measurement. Not every statistical operation can be used with every set of data. Data can be classified into four levels of measurement. They are as follows (from lowest to highest level):</p>
      <ul xml:id="eip-865">
        <li><em>Nominal scale level</em></li>
        <li><em>Ordinal scale level</em></li>
        <li><em>Interval scale level</em></li>
        <li><em>Ratio scale level</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p xml:id="eip-925">Data that is measured using a <term xml:id="term-00002">nominal scale</term> is <em>qualitative (categorical)</em>. Categories, colors, names, labels, and favorite foods along with yes or no responses are examples of nominal level data. Nominal scale data are not ordered. For example, trying to classify people according to their favorite food does not make any sense. Putting pizza first and sushi second is not meaningful.</p>
      <p xml:id="eip-817">Smartphone companies are another example of nominal scale data. The data are the names of the companies that make smartphones, but there is no agreed upon order of these brands, even though people may have personal preferences. Nominal scale data cannot be used in calculations.</p>
      <p xml:id="eip-369">Data that is measured using an <term xml:id="term-00003">ordinal scale</term> is similar to nominal scale data but there is a big difference. The ordinal scale data can be ordered. An example of ordinal scale data is a list of the top five national parks in the United States. The top five national parks in the United States can be ranked from one to five but we cannot measure differences between the data.</p>
      <p xml:id="eip-289">Another example of using the ordinal scale is a cruise survey where the responses to questions about the cruise are <em>excellent</em>, <em>good</em>, <em>satisfactory</em>, and <em>unsatisfactory</em>. These responses are ordered from the most desired response to the least desired. But the differences between two pieces of data cannot be measured. Like the nominal scale data, ordinal scale data cannot be used in calculations.</p>
      <p xml:id="eip-158">Like data measured on an ordinal scale, data that are measured on an <term xml:id="term-00004">interval scale</term> have a definite ordering. While ordinal scale data are categorical, or qualitative, interval scale data are numerical, or quantitative. It is possible to calculate differences between values measured on an interval scale. There is no minimum or "zero" value, however.</p>
      <p xml:id="eip-134">Temperature scales like Celsius (C) and Fahrenheit (F) are measured by using the interval scale. In both temperature measurements, 40° is equal to 100° minus 60°. Differences make sense. But 0 degrees does not represent a minimum value. In both scales, 0 is not the absolute lowest temperature. Temperatures like 10 °F and 15 °C exist and are colder than 0.</p>
      <p xml:id="eip-558">Data that are measured using the <term xml:id="term-00005">ratio scale</term> give the most information. Ratio scale data is like interval scale data, but there is a minimum value and ratios can be calculated. For example, four multiple choice statistics final exam scores are 80, 68, 20 and 92 (out of a possible 100 points). The exams are machine-graded.</p>
      <p xml:id="eip-53">The data can be put in order from lowest to highest  20, 68, 80, 92.</p>
      <p xml:id="eip-750">The differences between the data have meaning. The score 92 is more than the score 68 by 24 points.
    Ratios can be calculated. The minimum score is 0. So 80 is four times 20. The score of 80 is four times better than the score of 20.</p>

    <title>Sampling Experiment and Design</title>
    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164564810562">
      <p xml:id="fs-idm26748320">Does aspirin reduce the risk of heart attacks? Is one brand of fertilizer more effective at growing roses than another? Is fatigue as dangerous to a driver as speeding? Questions like these are answered using randomized experiments. In this module, you will learn important aspects of experimental design. Proper study design ensures the production of reliable, accurate data.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-id1164568065305">The purpose of an experiment is to investigate the relationship between two variables. In an experiment, there is the <alert>explanatory variable</alert> which affects the <alert>response variable</alert>. In a randomized experiment, the researcher manipulates the explanatory variable and then observes the response variable. Each value of the explanatory variable used in an experiment is called a <alert>treatment</alert>.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp20958864">You want to investigate the effectiveness of vitamin E in preventing disease. You recruit a group of subjects and ask them if they regularly take vitamin E. You notice that the subjects who take vitamin E exhibit better health on average than those who do not. Does this prove that vitamin E is effective in disease prevention? It does not. There are many differences between the two groups compared in addition to vitamin E consumption. People who take vitamin E regularly often take other steps to improve their health: exercise, diet, other vitamin supplements. Any one of these factors could be influencing health. As described, this study does not prove that vitamin E is the key to disease prevention.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idm26816896">Additional variables that can cloud a study are called <term xml:id="term-00001">lurking variables</term>. In order to prove that the explanatory variable is causing a change in the response variable, it is necessary to isolate the explanatory variable. The researcher must design her experiment in such a way that there is only one difference between groups being compared: the planned treatments. This is accomplished by the <term xml:id="term-00002">random assignment</term> of experimental units to treatment groups. When subjects are assigned treatments randomly, all of the potential lurking variables are spread equally among the groups. At this point the only difference between groups is the one imposed by the researcher. Different outcomes measured in the response variable, therefore, must be a direct result of the different treatments. In this way, an experiment can prove a cause-and-effect connection between the explanatory and response variables.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-id1164567483970">Confounding occurs when the effects of multiple factors on a response cannot be separated, for instance, if a student guesses on the even-numbered questions on an exam and sits in a favorite spot on exam day. Why does the student get a high test scores on the exam? It could be the increased study time or sitting in the favorite spot or both. Confounding makes it difficult to draw valid conclusions about the effect of each factor on the outcome. The way around this is to test several outcomes with one method (treatment). This way, we know which treatment really works.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idm40990544">The power of suggestion can have an important influence on the outcome of an experiment. Studies have shown that the expectation of the study participant can be as important as the actual medication. In one study of performance-enhancing substances, researchers noted the following:</p>
      <p xml:id="eip-753"><em>Results showed that believing one had taken the substance resulted in [</em>performance<em>] times almost as fast as those associated with consuming the substance itself. In contrast, taking the substance without knowledge yielded no significant performance increment.</em>McClung, M. and Collins, D. (2007 June). "Because I know it will!" Placebo effects of an ergogenic aid on athletic performance. Journal of Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology, 29(3), 382-94.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp21694240">When participation in a study prompts a physical response from a participant, it is difficult to isolate the effects of the explanatory variable. To counter the power of suggestion, researchers set aside one treatment group as a <term xml:id="term-00003">control group</term>. This group is given a <term xml:id="term-00004">placebo</term> treatment, a treatment that cannot influence the response variable. The control group helps researchers balance the effects of being in an experiment with the effects of the active treatments. Of course, if you are participating in a study and you know that you are receiving a pill that contains no actual medication, then the power of suggestion is no longer a factor. <term xml:id="term-00005">Blinding</term> in a randomized experiment designed to reduce bias by hiding information. When a person involved in a research study is blinded, he does not know who is receiving the active treatment(s) and who is receiving the placebo treatment. A <term xml:id="term-00006">double-blind experiment</term> is one in which both the subjects and the researchers involved with the subjects are blinded.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-id1170309538048">Sometimes, it is neither possible nor ethical for researchers to conduct experimental studies. For example, if you want to investigate whether malnutrition affects elementary school performance in children, it would not be appropriate to assign an experimental group to be malnourished. In these cases, <term xml:id="term-00007">observational studies</term> or <term xml:id="term-00008">surveys</term> may be used. In an observational study, the researcher does not directly manipulate the independent variable. Instead, he or she takes recordings and measurements of naturally occurring phenomena. By sorting these data into control and experimental conditions, the relationship between the dependent and independent variables can be drawn. In a survey, a researchers measurements consist of questionnaires that are answered by the research participants.</p>
      <example xml:id="fs-idm46263440">
        <statement>
          <p xml:id="fs-idm36907744">Researchers want to investigate whether taking aspirin regularly reduces the risk of a heart attack. 400 men between the ages of 50 and 84 are recruited as participants. The men are divided randomly into two groups: one group will take aspirin, and the other group will take a placebo. Each man takes one pill each day for three years, but he does not know whether he is taking aspirin or the placebo. At the end of the study, researchers count the number of men in each group who have had heart attacks.</p>
          <p xml:id="fs-idm23449264">Identify the following values for this study: population, sample, experimental units, explanatory variable, response variable, treatments.</p>

Participants were assigned at random to wear the floral mask during the first three trials or during the last three trials. For each trial, researchers recorded the time it took to complete the maze and the subject’s impression of the mask’s scent: positive, negative, or neutral.

      <title>Ethics</title>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp69338592">The widespread misuse and misrepresentation of statistical information often gives the field a bad name. Some say that “numbers don’t lie,” but the people who use numbers to support their claims often do.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp63161552">A recent investigation of famous social psychologist, Diederik Stapel, has led to the retraction of his articles from some of the world’s top journals including, <em>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Social Psychology, Basic and Applied Social Psychology, British Journal of Social Psychology,</em> and the magazine <em>Science</em>. Diederik Stapel is a former professor at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. Over the past two years, an extensive investigation involving three universities where Stapel has worked concluded that the psychologist is guilty of fraud on a colossal scale. Falsified data taints over 55 papers he authored and 10 Ph.D. dissertations that he supervised.</p>
      <p xml:id="eip-idm40688480"><em>Stapel did not deny that his deceit was driven by ambition. But it was more complicated than that, he told me. He insisted that he loved social psychology but had been frustrated by the messiness of experimental data, which rarely led to clear conclusions. His lifelong obsession with elegance and order, he said, led him to concoct results that journals found attractive. “It was a quest for aesthetics, for beauty—instead of the truth,” he said. He described his behavior as an addiction that drove him to carry out acts of increasingly daring fraud</em>.

      <p xml:id="fs-idp11297920">The committee investigating Stapel concluded that he is guilty of several practices including</p>
      <ul xml:id="fs-idp81387808">
        <li>creating datasets, which largely confirmed the prior expectations,</li>
        <li>altering data in existing datasets,</li>
        <li>changing measuring instruments without reporting the change, and</li>
        <li>misrepresenting the number of experimental subjects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp31763600">Clearly, it is never acceptable to falsify data the way this researcher did. Sometimes, however, violations of ethics are not as easy to spot.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp40590784">Researchers have a responsibility to verify that proper methods are being followed. The report describing the investigation of Stapel’s fraud states that, “statistical flaws frequently revealed a lack of familiarity with elementary statistics.”Tillburg University. (2012, Nov. 28). Flawed science: the fraudulent research practices of social psychologist Diederik Stapel. Retrieved from https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/upload/3ff904d7-547b-40ae-85fe-bea38e05a34a_Final%20report%20Flawed%20Science.pdf. Many of Stapel’s co-authors should have spotted irregularities in his data. Unfortunately, they did not know very much about statistical analysis, and they simply trusted that he was collecting and reporting data properly.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp112502080">Many types of statistical fraud are difficult to spot. Some researchers simply stop collecting data once they have just enough to prove what they had hoped to prove. They don’t want to take the chance that a more extensive study would complicate their lives by producing data contradicting their hypothesis.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp75599696">Professional organizations, like the American Statistical Association, clearly define expectations for researchers. There are even laws in the federal code about the use of research data.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp35202800">When a statistical study uses human participants, as in medical studies, both ethics and the law dictate that researchers should be mindful of the safety of their research subjects. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services oversees federal regulations of research studies with the aim of protecting participants. When a university or other research institution engages in research, it must ensure the safety of all human subjects. For this reason, research institutions establish oversight committees known as <term xml:id="term-00009">Institutional Review Boards (IRB)</term>. All planned studies must be approved in advance by the IRB. Key protections that are mandated by law include the following:</p>
      <ul xml:id="fs-idp105688032">
        <li>Risks to participants must be minimized and reasonable with respect to projected benefits.</li>
        <li>Participants must give <term xml:id="term-00010">informed consent</term>. This means that the risks of participation must be clearly explained to the subjects of the study. Subjects must consent in writing, and researchers are required to keep documentation of their consent.</li>
        <li>Data collected from individuals must be guarded carefully to protect their privacy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p xml:id="fs-idm5212816">These ideas may seem fundamental, but they can be very difficult to verify in practice. Is removing a participant’s name from the data record sufficient to protect privacy? Perhaps the person’s identity could be discovered from the data that remains. What happens if the study does not proceed as planned and risks arise that were not anticipated? When is informed consent really necessary? Suppose your doctor wants a blood sample to check your cholesterol level. Once the sample has been tested, you expect the lab to dispose of the remaining blood. At that point the blood becomes biological waste. Does a researcher have the right to take it for use in a study?</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp36402832">It is important that students of statistics take time to consider the ethical questions that arise in statistical studies. How prevalent is fraud in statistical studies? You might be surprised—and disappointed. There is a <url href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/40introone">website</url> dedicated to cataloging retractions of study articles that have been proven fraudulent. A quick glance will show that the misuse of statistics is a bigger problem than most people realize.</p>
      <p xml:id="fs-idp26995216">Vigilance against fraud requires knowledge. Learning the basic theory of statistics will empower you to analyze statistical studies critically.</p>

          <ol xml:id="fs-idp10407040">

            <li>No one seems to be home at four houses on her route. She does not record the addresses and does not return at a later time to try to find residents at home.</li>
            <li>She skips four houses on her route because she is running late for an appointment. When she gets home, she fills in the forms by selecting random answers from other residents in the neighborhood.</li>

          <ol xml:id="fs-idp82395040">
            <li>By selecting a convenient sample, the researcher is intentionally selecting a sample that could be biased. Claiming that this sample represents the community is misleading. The researcher needs to select areas in the community at random.</li>
            <li>Intentionally omitting relevant data will create bias in the sample. Suppose the researcher is gathering information about jobs and child care. By ignoring people who are not home, she may be missing data from working families that are relevant to her study. She needs to make every effort to interview all members of the target sample.</li>
            <li>It is never acceptable to fake data. Even though the responses she uses are <em>real</em> responses provided by other participants, the duplication is fraudulent and can create bias in the data. She needs to work diligently to interview everyone on her route.</li>

          <ol xml:id="fs-idp62071840">

            <li>If the researchers truly want to determine the favorite brand of juice, then researchers should ask teens to compare different brands of the same type of juice. Choosing a sweet juice to compare against a sharp-flavored juice will not lead to an accurate comparison of brand quality.</li>
            <li>Participants could be biased by the knowledge. The results may be different from those obtained in a blind taste test.</li>
