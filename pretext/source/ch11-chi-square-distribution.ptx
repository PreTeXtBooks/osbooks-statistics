    </note>
    <p>Have you ever wondered if lottery numbers were evenly distributed or if some numbers occurred with a greater frequency? How about if the types of movies people preferred were different across different age groups? What about if a coffee machine was dispensing approximately the same amount of coffee each time? You could answer these questions by conducting a hypothesis test.</p>
    <p>You will now study a new distribution, one that is used to determine the answers to such questions. This distribution is called the chi-square distribution.</p>
    <p>In this chapter, you will learn the three major applications of the chi-square distribution:

The goodness-of-fit test, which determines if data fit a particular distribution, such as in the lottery example
The test of independence, which determines if events are independent, such as in the movie example
The test of a single variance, which tests variability, such as in the coffee example</p>

      <title>NOTE</title>
      <p>Though the chi-square distribution depends on calculators or computers for most of the calculations, there is a table available (see <url href="m79717" />). TI-83+ and TI-84 calculator instructions are included in the text.</p>

      <title>Collaborative Classroom Exercise</title>
      <p>Look in the sports section of a newspaper or on the internet for some sports data: baseball averages, basketball scores, golf tournament scores, football odds, swimming times, and the like. Plot a histogram and a boxplot using your data. See if you can determine a probability distribution that your data fits. Have a discussion with the class about your choice.</p>

    <title>Facts About the Chi-Square Distribution</title>

    <p>The notation for the <term>chi-square distribution</term> is</p>
    <me>\chi\sim\chi_{df}^{2}</me>
    <p><nbsp />where <m>df</m> = degrees of freedom, which depends on how chi-square is being used. If you want to practice calculating chi-square probabilities then use <m>df</m> = <m>n</m> – 1. The degrees of freedom for the three major uses are calculated differently.</p>
    <p>For the <em>χ^{2}</em> distribution, the population mean is <m>μ</m> = <m>df</m>, and the population standard deviation is <m>\sigma=\sqrt{2(df)}</m>.</p>
    <p>The random variable is shown as <em>χ^{2}</em>, but it may be any uppercase letter.</p>
    <p>The random variable for a chi-square distribution with <m>k</m> degrees of freedom is the sum of <m>k</m> independent, squared standard normal variables is</p>
    <p><m>χ</m>^{2} = (<m>Z</m>_{1})^{2} + (<m>Z</m>_{2})^{2} + ... + (<m>Z</m>_{<m>k</m>})^{2}, where the following are true:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The curve is nonsymmetrical and skewed to the right.</li>
      <li>There is a different chi-square curve for each <m>df</m>.</li>
      <li>The test statistic for any test is always greater than or equal to zero.</li>
      <li>When <m>df</m> &gt; 90, the chi-square curve approximates the normal distribution. For <m>X</m> ~ <m>\chi_{1,000}^{2}</m>, the mean, <m>μ</m> = <m>df</m> = 1,000 and the standard deviation, <m>σ</m> = <m>\sqrt{2(1,000)}</m> = 44.7. Therefore, <m>X</m> ~ <m>N</m>(1,000, 44.7), approximately.</li>
      <li>The mean, <m>μ</m>, is located just to the right of the peak.</li>

    <title>Goodness-of-Fit Test</title>

    <p>In this type of hypothesis test, you determine whether the data fit a particular distribution. For example, you may suspect your unknown data fit a binomial distribution. You use a chi-square test, meaning the distribution for the hypothesis test is chi-square, to determine if there is a fit. The null and the alternative hypotheses for this test may be written in sentences or may be stated as equations or inequalities.</p>
    <p>The test statistic for a goodness-of-fit test is:</p>
    <me>\sum_{k}\frac{(O-E)^{2}}{E}</me>
    <p>where</p>
    <ul>
      <li><m>O</m> = <term>observed values</term> (data),</li>
      <li><m>E</m> = <term>expected values</term> (from theory), and</li>
      <li><m>k</m> = the number of different data cells or categories.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The observed values are the data values, and the expected values are the values you would expect to get if the null hypothesis were true. There are <m>n</m> terms of the form <m>\frac{(O-E)^{2}}{E}</m>.</p>
    <p>The number of degrees of freedom is <m>df</m> = (number of categories – 1).</p>
    <p>The goodness-of-fit test is almost always right-tailed. If the observed values and the corresponding expected values are not close to each other, then the test statistic can get very large and will be way out in the right tail of the chi-square curve.</p>

      <p>The expected value for each cell needs to be at least five for you to use this test.</p>

      <title>Day of the Week Employees Were Most Absent</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Employers want to know which days of the week employees are absent in a five-day work week. Most employers would like to believe that employees are absent equally during the week. Suppose a random sample of 60 managers were asked on which day of the week they had the highest number of employee absences. The results were distributed as in . For the population of employees, do the days for the highest number of absences occur with equal frequencies during a five-day work week? Test at a 5 percent significance level.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>H_{0}</em>: The absent days occur with equal frequencies; that is, they fit a uniform distribution.</li>
          <li><em>H_{a}</em>: The absent days occur with unequal frequencies; that is, they do not fit a uniform distribution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the absent days occur with equal frequencies, then, out of 60 absent days (the total in the sample: 15 + 12 + 9 + 9 + 15 = 60) there would be 12 absences on Monday, 12 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, 12 on Thursday, and 12 on Friday. These numbers are the <em>expected</em> (<m>E</m>) values. The values in the table are the <em>observed</em> (<m>O</m>) values or data.</p>
        <p>This time, calculate the <m>χ</m>^{2} test statistic by hand. Make a chart with the following headings  and fill in the columns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expected (<m>E</m>) values (12, 12, 12, 12, 12)</li>
          <li>Observed (<m>O</m>) values (15, 12, 9, 9, 15)</li>
          <li>(<m>O</m> – <m>E</m>)</li>
          <li>(<m>O</m> – <m>E</m>)^{2}</li>
          <li><m>\frac{(O\text{–}E)^{2}}{E}</m></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now add (sum) the last column. The sum is three. This is the <em>χ^{2}</em> test statistic.</p>
        <p>To find the <m>p</m>-value, calculate <m>P</m>(<m>χ</m>^{2} &gt; 3). This test is right-tailed. Use a computer or calculator to find the <m>p</m>-value. You should get <m>p</m>-value = 0.5578.</p>
        <p>The <m>df</m>s are the number of cells – 1 = 5 – 1 = 4.</p>

        <p>The decision is not to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>This problem asks you to test whether the far western U.S. families distribution fits the distribution of the American families. This test is always right-tailed.</p>
        <p>The first table contains expected percentages. To get expected (<m>E</m>) frequencies, multiply the percentage by 600. The expected frequencies are shown in .</p>
        <p>Therefore, the expected frequencies are 60, 96, 330, 66, and 48. In the TI calculators, you can let the calculator do the math. For example, instead of 60, enter 0.10 * 600.</p>

        <p>This problem can be set up as a goodness-of-fit problem. The sample space for flipping two fair coins is {<m>HH</m>, <m>HT</m>, <m>TH</m>, <m>TT</m>}.

    <title>Test of Independence</title>

    <p>Tests of independence involve using a <term>contingency table</term> of observed (data) values.</p>
    <p>The test statistic for a <term>test of independence</term> is similar to that of a goodness-of-fit test</p>
    <me>\sum_{(i⋅j)}\frac{(O-E)^{2}}{E}</me>
    <p>where</p>
    <ul>
      <li><m>O</m> = observed values,</li>
      <li><m>E</m> = expected values,</li>
      <li><m>i</m> = the number of rows in the table, and</li>
      <li><m>j</m> = the number of columns in the table.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are <m>i⋅j</m> terms of the form <m>\frac{(O-E)^{2}}{E}</m>.</p>
    <p>A test of independence determines whether two factors are independent. You first encountered the term <em>independence</em> in <url href="m79609">Probability Topics</url>. As a review, consider the following example.</p>
    <note xml:id="ch11-eip-155">
      <title>Note</title>
      <p>The expected value for each cell needs to be at least five for you to use this test.</p>
    </note>
    <example xml:id="element-54">
      <p>Suppose <m>A</m> = a speeding violation in the last year and <m>B</m> = a cell phone user while driving. If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent, then <m>P</m>(<m>A</m> AND <m>B</m>) = <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>)<m>P</m>(<m>B</m>). <m>A</m> AND <m>B</m> is the event that a driver received a speeding violation last year and also used a cell phone while driving. Suppose, in a study of drivers who received speeding violations in the last year, and who used cell phones while driving, that 755 people were surveyed. Out of the 755, 70 had a speeding violation and 685 did not; 305 used cell phones while driving and 450 did not.</p>
      <p>Let <m>y</m> = expected number of drivers who used a cell phone while driving and received speeding violations.</p>
      <p>If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent, then <m>P</m>(<m>A</m> AND <m>B</m>) = <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>)<m>P</m>(<m>B</m>). By substitution,</p>
      <p><m>\frac{y}{755}=(\frac{70}{755})(\frac{305}{755})\text{.}</m></p>
      <p>Solve for <m>y</m>: <m>y</m> = <m>\frac{(70)(305)}{755}=28.3\text{.}</m></p>
      <p>About 28 people from the sample are expected to use cell phones while driving and to receive speeding violations.</p>
      <p>In a test of independence, we state the null and alternative hypotheses in words. Since the contingency table consists of two factors, the null hypothesis states that the factors are independent and the alternative hypothesis states that they are not independent (dependent). If we do a test of independence using the example, then the null hypothesis is the following:</p>
      <p><em>H_{0}</em>: Being a cell phone user while driving and receiving a speeding violation are independent events.</p>
      <p>If the null hypothesis were true, we would expect about 28 people to use cell phones while driving and to receive a speeding violation.</p>
      <p>The test of independence is always right-tailed because of the calculation of the test statistic. If the expected and observed values are not close together, then the test statistic is very large and way out in the right tail of the chi-square curve, as it is in a goodness-of-fit.</p>
      <p>The number of degrees of freedom for the test of independence is</p>
      <p><m>df</m> = (number of columns – 1)(number of rows – 1).</p>
      <p>The following formula calculates the expected number (<m>E</m>):</p>
      <p><m>E=\frac{(row total)(column total)}{total number surveyed}</m></p>

    <title>Comparison of the Chi-Square Tests</title>

    <p>You have seen the <m>χ</m>^{2} test statistic used in three different circumstances. The following bulleted list is a summary that will help you decide which <m>χ</m>^{2} test is the appropriate one to use.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Goodness-of-Fit: Use the goodness-of-fit test to decide whether a population with an unknown distribution <em>fits</em> a known distribution. In this case there will be a single qualitative survey question or a single outcome of an experiment from a single population. Goodness-of-fit is typically used to see if the population is uniform (all outcomes occur with equal frequency), the population is normal, or the population is the same as another population with a known distribution. The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:
<nbsp /><em>H_{0}</em>: The population fits the given distribution.
<nbsp /><em>H_{a}</em>: The population does not fit the given distribution.</li>
      <li>Independence: Use the test for independence to decide whether two variables (factors) are independent or dependent. In this case there will be two qualitative survey questions or experiments and a contingency table will be constructed. The goal is to see if the two variables are unrelated/independent or related/dependent. The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:
<nbsp /><em>H_{0}</em>: The two variables (factors) are independent.
<nbsp /><em>H_{a}</em>: The two variables (factors) are dependent.</li>
      <li>Homogeneity: Use the test for homogeneity to decide if two populations with unknown distributions have the same distribution. In this case there will be a single qualitative survey question or experiment given to two different populations. The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:
<nbsp /><em>H_{0}</em>: The two populations follow the same distribution.
<nbsp /><em>H_{a}</em>: The two populations have different distributions.</li>
    </ul>

    <title>Test of a Single Variance</title>

    <p>A <term>test of a single variance</term> assumes that the underlying distribution is normal. The null and alternative hypotheses are stated in terms of the <term>population variance</term> or population standard deviation. The test statistic is</p>
    <me>\frac{(n-1)s^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}</me>
    <p>where</p>
    <ul>
      <li><m>n</m> = the total number of data,</li>
      <li><m>s</m>^{2} = sample variance, and</li>
      <li><m>σ</m>^{2} = population variance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may think of <m>s</m> as the random variable in this test. The number of degrees of freedom is <m>df</m> = <m>n</m> – 1. A test of a single variance may be right-tailed, left-tailed, or two-tailed.  will show you how to set up the null and alternative hypotheses. The null and alternative hypotheses contain statements about the population variance.</p>

      <statement>
        <p>Math instructors are not only interested in how their students do on exams, on average, but how the exam scores vary. To many instructors, the variance, or standard deviation, may be more important than the average.</p>
        <p>Suppose a math instructor believes that the standard deviation for his final exam is five points. One of his
best students thinks otherwise. The student claims that the standard deviation is more than five points. If the student were to conduct a hypothesis test, what would the null and alternative hypotheses be?</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>Even though we are given the population standard deviation, we can set up the test using the population variance as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>H_{0}</em>: <m>σ</m>^{2} = 5^{2}</li>
          <li><em>H_{a}</em>: <m>σ</m>^{2} &gt; 5^{2}</li>

      <statement>
        <p>With individual lines at its various windows, a post office finds that the standard deviation for normally distributed waiting times for customers on Friday afternoon is 7.2 minutes. The post office experiments with a single, main waiting line and finds that for a random sample of 25 customers, the waiting times for customers have a standard deviation of 3.5 minutes.</p>
        <p>With a significance level of 5 percent, test the claim that a single line causes lower variation
among waiting times (shorter waiting times) for customers.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>Since the claim is that a single line causes less variation, this is a test of a single variance.
The parameter is the population variance, <m>σ</m>^{2}, or the population standard deviation, <m>σ</m>.</p>
        <p>Random variable: The sample standard deviation, <m>s</m>, is the random variable.
Let <m>s</m> = standard deviation for the waiting times.</p>

        <p>The word <em>less</em> tells you this is a left-tailed test.</p>
        <p>Distribution for the test: <m>\chi_{24}^{2}</m>, where
<m>n</m> = the number of customers sampled, and
 <m>df</m> = <m>n</m> – 1 = 25 – 1 = 24.</p>
        <p>Calculate the test statistic:</p>
        <p><m>\chi^{2}=\frac{(n-1)s^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}=\frac{(25-1)(3.5)^{2}}{7.2^{2}}=5.67</m></p>

        <p>Probability statement: <m>p</m>-value = <m>P</m> ( <m>χ</m>^{2} &lt; 5.67) = 0.000042</p>
        <p>Compare <m>α</m> and the <m>p</m>-value:

<nbsp /><m>α</m> = 0.05
<nbsp /><m>p</m>-value = 0.000042
<nbsp /><m>α</m> &gt; <m>p</m>-value</p>
        <p>Make a decision: Since <m>α</m> &gt; <m>p</m>-value, reject <em>H_{0}</em>. This means that you reject <m>σ</m>^{2} = 7.2^{2}. In other words, you do not think the variation in waiting times is 7.2 minutes; you think the variation in waiting times is less.</p>
        <p>Conclusion: At a 5 percent level of significance, from the data, there is sufficient evidence to
conclude that a single line causes a lower variation among the waiting times <m>or</m> with a single
line, the customer waiting times vary less than 7.2 minutes.</p>
