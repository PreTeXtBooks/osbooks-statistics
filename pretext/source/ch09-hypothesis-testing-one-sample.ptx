      <title>Chapter Objectives</title>
      <p>By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Differentiate between Type I and Type II errors</li>
        <li>Describe hypothesis testing in general and in practice</li>
        <li>Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for a single population mean, population standard deviation known</li>
        <li>Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for a single population mean, population standard deviation unknown</li>
        <li>Conduct and interpret hypothesis tests for a single population proportion</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
    <p>One job of a statistician is to make statistical inferences about populations based on samples taken from the population. <term>Confidence intervals</term> are one way to estimate a population parameter. Another way to make a statistical inference is to make a decision about a parameter. For instance, a car dealer advertises that its new small truck gets 35 miles per gallon, on average. A tutoring service claims that its method of tutoring helps 90 percent of its students get an A or a B. A company says that women managers in their company earn an average of $60,000 per year.</p>
    <p>A statistician will make a decision about these claims. This process is called <term>hypothesis testing.</term> A hypothesis test involves collecting data from a sample and evaluating the data. Then, the statistician makes a decision as to whether or not there is sufficient evidence, based upon analyses of the data, to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
    <p>In this chapter, you will conduct hypothesis tests on single means and single proportions.
    You will also learn about the errors associated with these tests.</p>
    <p>Hypothesis testing consists of two contradictory hypotheses or statements, a decision based on the data, and a conclusion. To perform a hypothesis test, a statistician will do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Set up two contradictory hypotheses.</li>
      <li>Collect sample data. In homework problems, the data or summary statistics will be given to you.</li>
      <li>Determine the correct distribution to perform the hypothesis test.</li>
      <li>Analyze sample data by performing the calculations that ultimately will allow you to reject or decline to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
      <li>Make a decision and write a meaningful conclusion.</li>
    </ol>

    <title>Null and Alternative Hypotheses</title>


    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164566387137">
      <p>The actual test begins by considering two <term>hypotheses</term>. They are called the <term>null hypothesis</term> and the <term>alternative hypothesis</term>. These hypotheses contain opposing viewpoints.</p>
      <p><em>H_{0}</em>, the null hypothesis: a statement of no difference between sample means or proportions or no difference between a sample mean or proportion and a population mean or proportion. In other words, the difference equals 0.</p>
      <p><em>H_{a}</em>, the alternative hypothesis: a claim about the population that is contradictory to <em>H_{0}</em> and what we conclude when we reject <em>H_{0}</em>.</p>
      <p>Since the null and alternative hypotheses are contradictory, you must examine evidence to decide if you have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not. The evidence is in the form of sample data.</p>
      <p>After you have determined which hypothesis the sample supports, you make a decision.
There are two options for a decision. They are <em>reject</em> <em>H_{0}</em> if the sample information favors the alternative hypothesis or <em>do not reject</em> <em>H_{0}</em> or <em>decline to reject</em> <em>H_{0}</em> if the sample information is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

        <p><em>H_{0}</em> always has a symbol with an equal in it. <em>H_{a}</em> never has a symbol with an equal in it. The choice of symbol depends on the wording of the hypothesis test. However, be aware that many researchers use = in the null hypothesis, even with &gt; or &lt; as the symbol in the alternative hypothesis. This practice is acceptable because we only make the decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.</p>

      <title>Chapter Review</title>
      <p>In a hypothesis test, sample data are evaluated in order to arrive at a decision about some type of claim. If certain conditions about the sample are satisfied, then the claim can be evaluated for a population. In a hypothesis test, we do the following:


Evaluate the null hypothesis, typically denoted with <em>H_{0}</em>. The null is not rejected unless the hypothesis test shows otherwise. The null statement must always contain some form of equality (=, ≤, or ≥).

Always write the alternative hypothesis, typically denoted with <em>H_{a}</em> or <em>H_{1}</em>, using less than, greater than, or not equals symbols, i.e., (≠, &gt;, or &lt;).

If we reject the null hypothesis, then we can assume there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.

Never state that a claim is proven true or false. Keep in mind the underlying fact that hypothesis testing is based on probability laws; therefore, we can talk only in terms of non-absolute certainties.</p>

    <title>Outcomes and the Type I and Type II Errors</title>


    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164565232863">
      <p>When you perform a hypothesis test, there are four possible outcomes depending on the actual truth, or falseness, of the null hypothesis <em>H_{0}</em> and the decision to reject or not. The outcomes are summarized in the following table:</p>
      <table xml:id="ch9-element-689">
          <title>Data Table</title><tabular>
          <row><cell>ACTION</cell><cell><em>H_{0}</em> IS ACTUALLY</cell><cell>...</cell></row>
          <row><cell /><cell>True</cell><cell>False</cell></row>
          <row><cell>Do not reject <em>H_{0}</em></cell><cell>Correct outcome</cell><cell>Type II error</cell></row>
          <row><cell>Reject <em>H_{0}</em></cell><cell>Type I error</cell><cell>Correct outcome</cell></row>
        </tabular>
      </table>
      <p>The four possible outcomes in the table are as follows:
    The decision is <em>not to reject <em>H_{0}</em></em> when <em>H_{0}</em> is true (correct decision).

      The decision is to <em>reject <em>H_{0}</em></em> when, in fact, <em><em>H_{0}</em> is true</em> (incorrect decision known as a <term>Type I error</term>).

      The decision is <em>not to reject <em>H_{0}</em></em> when, in fact, <em>H_{0}</em> is false (incorrect decision known as a <term>Type II error</term>).

      The decision is to <em>reject <em>H_{0}</em></em> when <em>H_{0}</em> is false (correct decision whose probability is called the Power of the Test).</p>
      <p>Each of the errors occurs with a particular probability. The Greek letters <m>α</m> and <m>β</m> represent the probabilities.</p>
      <p><m>α</m> = probability of a Type I error = <m>P</m>(Type I error) = probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.</p>
      <p><m>β</m> = probability of a Type II error = <m>P</m>(Type II error) = probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.</p>
      <p><m>α</m> and <m>β</m> should be as small as possible because they are probabilities of errors. They are rarely zero.</p>
      <p>The Power of the Test is 1 – <m>β</m>. Ideally, we want a high power that is as close to one as possible. Increasing the sample size can increase the Power of the Test.</p>
      <p>The following are examples of Type I and Type II errors.</p>
      <example xml:id="element-484">
        <statement>
          <p>Suppose the null hypothesis, <em>H_{0}</em>, is: Frank's rock climbing equipment is safe.</p>
          <p>Type I error: Frank does not go rock climbing because he considers that the equipment is not safe, when in fact, the equipment is really safe. Frank is making the mistake of rejecting the null hypothesis, when the equipment is actually safe!</p>
          <p>Type II error: Frank goes climbing, thinking that his equipment is safe, but this is a mistake, and he painfully realizes that his equipment is not as safe as it should have been. Frank assumed that the null hypothesis was true, when it was not.</p>
          <p><em>α = probability</em> that Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment may not be safe when, in fact, it really is safe. <em>β = probability</em> that Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment may be safe when, in fact, it is not safe.</p>
          <p>Notice that, in this case, the error with the greater consequence is the Type II error. (If Frank thinks his rock climbing equipment is safe, he will go ahead and use it.)</p>

      <statement>
          <p><em>Red tide</em> is a bloom of poison-producing algae—a few different species of a class of plankton called dinoflagellates. When the weather and water conditions cause these blooms, shellfish such as clams living in the area develop dangerous levels of a paralysis-inducing toxin. In Massachusetts, the Division of Marine Fisheries  montors levels of the toxin in shellfish by regular sampling of shellfish along the coastline. If the mean level of toxin in clams exceeds 800 μg (micrograms) of toxin per kilogram of clam meat in any area, clam harvesting is banned there until the bloom is over and levels of toxin in clams subside. Describe both a Type I and a Type II error in this context, and state which error has the greater consequence.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>In this scenario, an appropriate null hypothesis would be <em>H_{0}</em>: the mean level of toxins is at most 800 <m>μ</m>g,  <em>H_{0}</em> : <m>μ</m>_{0} ≤ 800 <m>μ</m>g.</p>
          <p>Type I error: The DMF believes that toxin levels are still too high when, in fact, toxin levels are at most 800 <m>μ</m>g. The DMF continues the harvesting ban.</p>

The DMF lifts the harvesting ban. This error could be the most serious. If the ban is lifted and clams are still toxic, consumers could possibly eat tainted food.</p>

    <title>Distribution Needed for Hypothesis Testing</title>


    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164564493277">
      <p>Earlier in the course, we discussed sampling distributions. <em>Particular distributions are associated with hypothesis testing.</em> Perform tests of a population mean using a <term>normal distribution</term> or a <term>Student's <m>t</m>-distribution</term>. (Remember, use a Student's <m>t</m>-distribution when the population <term>standard deviation</term> is unknown and the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal.) We perform tests of a population proportion using a normal distribution (usually <m>n</m> is large).</p>

      <title>Assumptions</title>
      <p>When you perform <em>a hypothesis test of a single population mean <m>μ</m></em> using a
<term>Student's <m>t</m>-distribution</term> (often called a <m>t</m>-test), there are fundamental assumptions that need to be met in order for the test to work properly. Your data should be a <term>simple random sample</term> that comes from a population that is approximately <term>normally distributed</term>. You use the sample <term>standard deviation</term> to approximate the population standard deviation. Note that if the sample size is sufficiently large, a <m>t</m>-test will work even if the population is not approximately normally distributed.</p>
      <p>When you perform a <em>hypothesis test of a single population mean <m>μ</m></em> using a
normal distribution (often called a <m>z</m>-test), you take a simple random sample from the population. The population you are testing is normally distributed or your sample size is sufficiently large. You know the value of the population standard deviation which, in reality, is rarely known.</p>
      <p>When you perform a <em>hypothesis test of a single population proportion <m>p</m></em>, you
  take a simple random sample from the population. You must meet the conditions for a <term>binomial distribution</term>, which are the following: there are a certain number <m>n</m> of independent trials, the outcomes of any trial are success or failure, and each trial has the same probability of a success <m>p</m>. The shape of the binomial distribution needs to be similar to the shape of the normal distribution. To ensure this, the quantities <m>np</m> and <m>nq</m> must both be greater than five (<m>np</m> &gt; 5 and <m>nq</m> &gt; 5). Then the binomial distribution of a sample (estimated) proportion can be approximated by the normal distribution with <m>μ</m> = <m>p</m> and <m>\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}</m>.

      <p>Establishing the type of distribution, sample size, and known or unknown standard deviation can help you figure out how to go about a hypothesis test. However, there are several other factors you should consider when working out a hypothesis test.</p>

      <title>Rare Events</title>
      <p>The thinking process in hypothesis testing can be summarized as follows: You want to test whether or not a particular property of the population is true. You make an assumption about the true population mean for numerical data or the true population proportion for categorical data. This assumption is the null hypothesis. Then you gather sample data that is representative of the population. From this sample data you compute the sample mean (or the sample proportion). If the value that you observe is very unlikely to occur (a rare event) if the null hypothesis is true, then you wonder why this is happening. A plausible explanation is that the null hypothesis is false.</p>
      <p>For example, Didi and Ali are at a birthday party of a very wealthy friend. They hurry to be first in line to grab a prize from a tall basket that they cannot see inside because they will be blindfolded. There are 200 plastic bubbles in the basket, and Didi and Ali have been told that there is only one with a $100 bill. Didi is the first person to reach into the basket and pull out a bubble. Her bubble contains a $100 bill. The probability of this happening is <m>\frac{1}{200}</m> = 0.005. Because this is so unlikely, Ali is hoping that what the two of them were told is wrong and there are more $100 bills in the basket. A <em>rare event</em> has occurred (Didi getting the $100 bill) so Ali doubts the assumption about only one $100 bill being in the basket.</p>

      <title>Using the Sample to Test the Null Hypothesis</title>
      <p>After you collect data and obtain the test statistic (the sample mean, sample proportion, or other test statistic), you can determine the probability of obtaining that test statistic when the null hypothesis is true. This probability is called the <term><m>p</m>-value</term>.</p>
      <p>When the <m>p</m>-value is very small, it means that the observed test statistic is very unlikely to happen if the null hypothesis is true. This gives significant evidence to suggest that the null hypothesis is false, and to reject it in favor of the alternative hypothesis. In practice, to reject the null hypothesis we want the <m>p</m>-value to be smaller than 0.05 (5 percent) or sometimes even smaller than 0.01 (1 percent).</p>
      <example xml:id="element-804">
        <statement>
          <p>Suppose a baker claims that his bread height is more than 15 cm, on average. Several of his customers do not believe him. To persuade his customers that he is right, the baker decides to do a hypothesis test. He bakes 10 loaves of bread. The mean height of the sample loaves is 17 cm. The baker knows from baking hundreds of loaves of bread that the <term>standard deviation</term> for the height is 0.5 cm and the distribution of heights is normal.</p>
          <p>The null hypothesis could be <em>H_{0}</em>: <m>μ</m> ≤ 15. The alternate hypothesis is <em>H_{a}</em>: <m>μ</m> &gt; 15.</p>
          <p>The words <em>is more than</em> translates as a "&gt;" so "<m>μ</m> &gt; 15" goes into the alternate hypothesis. The null hypothesis must contradict the alternate hypothesis.</p>
          <p>Since <em>σ is known</em> (<m>σ</m> = 0.5 cm), the distribution for the population is known to be normal with mean <m>μ</m> = 15 and standard deviation <m>\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}=\frac{0.5}{\sqrt{10}}=0.16</m>.</p>
          <p>Suppose the null hypothesis is true (which is that the mean height of the loaves is no more than 15 cm). Then is the mean height (17 cm) calculated from the sample unexpectedly large? The hypothesis test works by asking the question how <em>unlikely</em> the sample mean would be if the null hypothesis were true. The graph shows how far out the sample mean is on the normal curve. The <m>p</m>-value is the probability that, if we were to take other samples, any other sample mean would fall at least as far out as 17 cm.</p>
          <p><em>The <m>p</m>-value, then, is the probability that a sample mean is the same or greater than 17 cm when the population mean is, in fact, 15 cm.</em> We can calculate this probability using the normal distribution for means. In , the <m>p</m>-value is the area under the normal curve to the right of 17. Using a normal distribution table or a calculator, we can compute that this probability is practically zero.</p>

          <p><m>p</m>-value = <m>P</m>(<m>\overline{x}</m> &gt; 17), which is approximately zero.</p>
          <p>Because the <m>p</m>-value is almost 0, we conclude that obtaining a sample height of 17 cm or higher from 10 loaves of bread is very unlikely if the true mean height is 15 cm. We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to claim that the true population mean height of the baker’s loaves of bread is higher than 15 cm.</p>

      <title>Decision and Conclusion</title>
      <p>A systematic way to make a decision of whether to reject or not reject the <term>null hypothesis</term>
is to compare the <m>p</m>-value and a preset or preconceived <m>α</m>, also called the <term>level of significance of the test</term>. A preset <m>α</m> is the probability of a <term>Type I error</term> (rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true). It may or may not be given to you at the beginning of the problem.</p>
      <p>When you make a <em>decision</em> to reject or not reject <em>H_{0}</em>, do as follows:
If <m>p</m>-value <m>&lt; α</m>, reject <em>H_{0}</em>. The results of the sample data are significant. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that <em>H_{0}</em> is an incorrect belief and that the alternative hypothesis, <em>H_{a}</em>, may be correct.
If <m>p</m>-value <m>\geq α</m>, do not reject <em>H_{0}</em>. The results of the sample data are not significant.There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the alternative hypothesis, <em>H_{a}</em>, may be correct.
When you <em>do not reject H_{0}</em>, it does not mean that you should believe that <em>H_{0}</em> is true. It simply means that the sample data have <em>failed</em> to provide sufficient evidence to cast serious doubt about the truthfulness of <em>H_{0}</em>.</p>
      <p>Conclusion: After you make your decision, write a thoughtful <em>conclusion</em> about the hypotheses in terms of the given problem.</p>

      <p>When the probability of an event occurring is low, and it happens, it is called a rare event.

        <li>In a <term>hypothesis test</term> problem, you may see words such as "the level of significance is 1 percent". The "1 percent" is the preconceived or preset <m>α</m>.</li>
        <li>The statistician setting up the hypothesis test selects the value of <m>α</m> to use <em>before</em> collecting the sample data.</li>

        <li>When you calculate the <m>p</m>-value and draw the picture, the <m>p</m>-value is the area in the left tail, the right tail, or split evenly between the two tails. For this reason, we call the hypothesis test left, right, or two tailed.</li>
        <li>The alternative hypothesis, <m>H_{a}</m>, tells you if the test is left, right, or two-tailed. It is the <em>key</em> to conducting the appropriate test.</li>

Similarly, for a large <m>p</m>-value such as 0.4, as opposed to a <m>p</m>-value of 0.056 (alpha = 0.05 is less than either number), a data analyst should have more confidence that she made the correct decision in not rejecting the null hypothesis.

      <title>Full Hypothesis Test Examples</title>
      <example xml:id="element-396">
        <statement>
          <p>Jeffrey, as an eight-year-old, established a mean time of 16.43 seconds for swimming the 25-yard freestyle, with a standard deviation of 0.8 seconds. His dad, Frank, thought that Jeffrey could swim the 25-yard freestyle faster using goggles. Frank bought Jeffrey a new pair of expensive goggles and timed Jeffrey for 15 25-yard freestyle swims. For the 15 swims, Jeffrey's mean time was 16 seconds. Frank thought that the goggles helped Jeffrey to swim faster than the 16.43 seconds. Conduct a hypothesis test using a preset <m>α</m> = 0.05. Assume that the swim times for the 25-yard freestyle are normal.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Set up the hypothesis test:</p>
          <p>Since the problem is about a mean, this is a <em>test of a single population mean</em>.</p>
          <p><em>H_{0}</em>: <m>μ</m> = 16.43  <em>H_{a}</em>: <m>μ</m> &lt; 16.43</p>
          <p>For Jeffrey to swim faster, his time will be less than 16.43 seconds. The "&lt;" tells you this is left-tailed.</p>
          <p>Determine the distribution needed:</p>
          <p>Random variable: <m>X</m> = the mean time to swim the 25-yard freestyle.</p>
          <p>Distribution for the test:  <m>X</m> is normal (population standard deviation is known: <m>σ</m> = 0.8)</p>
          <p>with mean <m>\mu=16.43</m> and standard error of <m>\frac{0.8}{\sqrt{15}}</m>;</p>
          <p><m>μ</m> = 16.43 comes from <em>H_{0}</em> and not the data. <m>σ</m> = 0.8, and <m>n</m> = 15.</p>
          <p>Using a table or a calculator, we can calculate the <m>p</m>-value as the area to the left of 16 under the normal curve:</p>
          <p><m>p</m>-value = <m>P</m>(<m>\overline{x}</m> &lt; 16) = 0.0187 where the sample mean in the problem is given as 16.</p>
          <p><m>p</m>-value = 0.0187. The <m>p</m>-value is the area to the left of the sample mean given as 16.</p>
          <p>Graph:</p>
          <p><m>μ</m> = 16.43 comes from <em>H_{0}</em>. Our assumption is <m>μ</m> = 16.43.</p>
          <p>Interpretation of the <m>p</m>-value: <em>If <em>H_{0}</em> is true</em>, there is a 0.0187 probability (1.87 percent), that Jeffrey's mean time to swim the 25-yard freestyle is 16 seconds or less. Because a 1.87 percent chance is small, the mean time of 16 seconds or less is unlikely to have happened randomly. It is a rare event.</p>
          <p>Compare <m>α</m> and the <m>p</m>-value:</p>
          <p><m>α</m> = 0.05   <m>p</m>-value = 0.0187   <m>α</m> &gt; <m>p</m>-value</p>
          <p>Make a decision: Since <m>α</m> &gt; <m>p</m>-value, reject <em>H_{0}</em>.</p>
          <p>An alternative approach is to find the <m>z</m>-test corresponding to the sample mean <m>\overline{x}=16.</m> This is <m>z\text{-test}=\frac{\overline{x}-\mu_{X}}{\frac{\sigma_{X}}{\sqrt{n}}}=\frac{16-16.43}{\frac{0.8}{\sqrt{15}}}=-2.081729</m>.</p>
          <p>The critical <m>z</m>-value = –1.645 for this test has probability 0.05 to its left tail, according to the Normal Table (see Appendices). Because the <m>z</m>-test is <em>to the left</em> of the critical <m>z</m>-value, we reject the null hypothesis.</p>
          <p>This means that you reject <m>μ</m> = 16.43. In other words, you do not think Jeffrey swims the 25-yard freestyle in 16.43 seconds but instead that he swims faster with the new goggles.</p>
          <p>Conclusion: At the 5 percent significance level, we conclude that Jeffrey swims faster using the new goggles. The sample data show there is sufficient evidence that Jeffrey's mean time to swim the 25-yard freestyle is less than 16.43 seconds.</p>
          <p>The <m>p</m>-value can easily be calculated.</p>
          <p>Press <c>STAT</c> and arrow over to <c>TESTS</c>. Press <c>1:<m>z</m>-Test</c>. Arrow over to <c>Stats</c> and press <c>ENTER</c>. Arrow down and enter 16.43 for <em>μ_{0}</em> (null hypothesis), .8 for <m>σ</m>, 16 for the sample mean, and 15 for <m>n</m>. Arrow down to <m>μ</m> : (alternate hypothesis) and arrow over to &lt; <em>μ_{0}</em>. Press <c>ENTER</c>. Arrow down to <c>Calculate</c> and press <c>ENTER</c>. The calculator not only calculates the <m>p</m>-value (<m>p</m> = 0.0187) but it also calculates the test statistic (<m>z</m>-score) for the sample mean. <m>μ</m> &lt; 16.43 is the alternative hypothesis. Do this set of instructions again except arrow to <c>Draw</c>(instead of <c>Calculate</c>). Press <c>ENTER</c>. A shaded graph appears with <m>z</m> = -2.08 (test statistic) and <m>p</m> = 0.0187 (<m>p</m>-value). Make sure when you use <c>Draw</c> that no other equations are highlighted in <m>Y</m> = and the plots are turned off.</p>
          <p>When the calculator does a <m>z</m>-Test, the <c><m>z</m>-Test</c> function finds the <m>p</m>-value by doing a normal probability calculation:</p>
          <p><m>P(\overline{x}&lt;16)=</m> <c>2nd DISTR normcdf</c> <m>(-10^99,16,16.43,0.8/\sqrt{15})\text{.}</m></p>
          <p>The Type I and Type II errors for this problem are as follows:</p>
          <p>The Type I error is to conclude that Jeffrey swims the 25-yard freestyle, on average, in
less than 16.43 seconds when, in fact, he actually swims the 25-yard freestyle, on
average, in 16.43 seconds. (Reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.)</p>
          <p>The Type II error is that there is not evidence to conclude that Jeffrey swims the 25-yard freestyle, on average, in less than 16.43 seconds when, in fact, he actually does swim the 25-yard freestyle, on average, in less than 16.43 seconds. (Do not reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.)</p>

        <title>Historical Note (</title>
        <p>The traditional way to compare the two probabilities, <m>α</m> and the <m>p</m>-value, is to compare the critical value (<m>z</m>-score from <m>α</m>) to the test statistic (<m>z</m>-score from data). The calculated test statistic for the <m>p</m>-value is –2.08. (From the central limit theorem, the test statistic formula is <m>z=\frac{\overline{x}-\mu_{X}}{(\frac{\sigma_{X}}{\sqrt{n}})}</m>.


For this problem, <m>\overline{x}</m> = 16, <em>μ_{X}</em> = 16.43 from the null hypothesis, <em>σ_{X}</em> = 0.8, and <m>n</m> = 15.) You can find the critical value for <m>α</m> = 0.05 in the normal table (see <xref ref="appendix-h-tables">Appendix H: Tables</xref>). The <m>z</m>-score for an area to the left equal to 0.05 is midway between –1.65 and –1.64 (0.05 is midway between 0.0505 and 0.0495). The <m>z</m>-score is –1.645. Since –1.645 &gt; –2.08 (which demonstrates that α &gt; <m>p</m>-value), reject <em>H_{0}</em>. Traditionally, the decision
to reject or not reject was done in this way. Today, comparing the two probabilities <m>α</m> and the <m>p</m>-value is very common. For this problem, the <m>p</m>-value, 0.0187, is considerably smaller than <m>α</m>, 0.05. You can be confident about your decision to reject. The graph shows <m>α</m>, the <m>p</m>-value, and the test statistic and the critical value.</p>

        <p>Distribution for the test: If you read the problem carefully, you will notice that there is
<em>no population standard deviation given</em>. You are only given <m>n</m> = 10 sample data values. Notice also that the data come from a normal distribution. This means that the distribution for the test is a Student's <m>t</m>-distribution.</p>
        <p>Use <m>t</m>-distribution. Therefore, the distribution for the test is <m>t</m> with nine degrees of freedom.</p>
        <p>Calculate the <m>p</m>-value using the Student's <m>t</m>-distribution:</p>
        <p>First, we compute the sample mean as</p>
        <p>Next, we compute the <m>t</m>-test as</p>
        <p>The <m>p</m>-value is the probability to the right tail of 1.98 in a <m>t</m>-distribution with nine degrees of freedom.</p>
        <p><m>p</m>-value = <m>P</m>(<m>\overline{x}</m> &gt; 67) = 0.0396 where the sample mean and sample standard deviation are calculated as 67 and 3.1972 from the data.</p>
        <p>Interpretation of the <m>p</m>-value: If the null hypothesis is true, then there is a 0.0396
probability (3.96 percent) that the sample mean is 65 or more.</p>
        <p>Compare <m>α</m> and the <m>p</m>-value:</p>
        <p>Since <m>α</m> = 0.05 and <m>p</m>-value = 0.0396, <m>α</m> &gt; <m>p</m>-value.</p>
        <p>Make a decision: Since <m>α</m> &gt; <m>p</m>-value, reject <em>H_{0}</em>.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, according to a Student's <m>t</m>-distribution table (see Appendices), the critical <m>t</m>-value is 1.833. Since the <m>t</m>-test (1.98) is to the right of the critical <m>t</m>-value 1.833, we reject the null hypothesis.</p>
        <p>This decision means we reject <m>μ</m> = 65. In other words, we believe the average test score is more than 65.</p>
        <p>Conclusion: At a 5 percent level of significance, the sample data show sufficient evidence that the mean (average) test score is more than 65, just as the math instructor thinks.</p>
        <p>The <m>p</m>-value can easily be calculated.</p>

        <p>Joon believes that 50 percent of first-time brides in the United States are younger than their grooms. She performs a hypothesis test to determine if the percentage is the same or different from 50 percent. Joon samples 100 first-time brides and 53 reply that they are younger than their grooms. For the hypothesis test, she uses a 1 percent level of significance.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>Set up the hypothesis test:</p>
        <p>The 1 percent level of significance means that <m>α</m> = 0.01. This is a <em>test of a single population proportion</em>.</p>
        <p><em>H_{0}</em>: <m>p</m> = 0.50  <em>H_{a}</em>: <m>p</m> ≠ 0.50</p>
        <p>The words <em>is the same or different from</em> tell you this is a two-tailed test.</p>
        <p>Calculate the distribution needed:</p>
        <p>Random variable: <m>P′</m> = the percentage of first-time brides who are younger than their grooms.</p>
        <p>Distribution for the test: The problem contains no mention of a mean. The information is given in terms of percentages. Use the distribution for <m>P′</m>, the estimated proportion.</p>
        <p><m>P′</m> follows a normal distribution with mean value <m>\mu=p,</m> and standard error <m>\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{p⋅q}{n}.}</m></p>
        <p>In our example, <m>p</m> = <m>q</m> = 0.5, and <m>n</m> = 100, <nbsp />where <m>p</m> = 0.50, <m>q</m> = 1 – <m>p</m> = 0.50, and <m>n</m> = 100.</p>
        <p>Calculate the <m>p</m>-value using the normal distribution for proportions:</p>
        <p>First, we compute the sample proportion as <m>p=\frac{53}{100}=0.53.</m></p>
        <p>Next, the <m>z</m>-test is given by</p>
        <p>Since the <m>z</m>-test is positive, we compute the area to the right tail of 0.6 in a normal distribution, <m>P(Z&gt;0.6)=\text{0}\text{.2742531}\text{.}</m> Finally, because this is a two-sided test of significance, we multiply this probability times two to account for the left tail, and obtain <m>p\text{-value}=2\times0.2742531=0.5485062</m></p>
        <p>where <m>x</m> = 53, <m>p′</m> = <m>\frac{x}{n}\text{=}\frac{\text{53}}{\text{100}}</m> = 0.53.</p>
        <p>Interpretation of the <m>p</m>-value: If the null hypothesis is true, there is 0.5485 probability,
(54.85 percent) that the sample (estimated) proportion <m>p′</m> is 0.53 or more OR 0.47 or less (see
the graph in ).</p>
        <p><m>μ</m> = <m>p</m> = 0.50 comes from <em>H_{0}</em>, the null hypothesis.</p>
        <p><m>p′</m> = 0.53. Since the curve is symmetrical and the test is two-tailed, the <m>p′</m> for the left tail is equal to 0.50 – 0.03 = 0.47 where <m>μ</m> = <m>p</m> = 0.50. (0.03 is the difference between 0.53 and 0.50.)</p>
        <p>Compare <m>α</m> and the <m>p</m>-value:</p>
        <p>Since <m>α</m> = 0.01 and <m>p</m>-value = 0.5485, <m>α</m> &lt; <m>p</m>-value.</p>
        <p>Make a decision: Since <m>α</m> &lt; <m>p</m>-value, you cannot reject <em>H_{0}</em>.</p>
        <p>Conclusion: At the 1 percent level of significance, the sample data do not show sufficient evidence that the percentage of first-time brides who are younger than their grooms is different from 50 percent.</p>
        <p>The <m>p</m>-value can easily be calculated.</p>

        <p>My dog has so many fleas,<nbsp />
They do not come off with ease.<nbsp />
As for shampoo, I have tried many types<nbsp />
Even one called Bubble Hype,<nbsp />
Which only killed 25 percent of the fleas,<nbsp />
Unfortunately I was not pleased.<nbsp /><nbsp />
I've used all kinds of soap,<nbsp />
Until I had given up hope<nbsp />
Until one day I saw<nbsp />
An ad that put me in awe.<nbsp /><nbsp />
A shampoo used for dogs<nbsp />
Called GOOD ENOUGH to Clean a Hog<nbsp />
Guaranteed to kill more fleas.<nbsp /><nbsp />
I gave Fido a bath<nbsp />
And after doing the math<nbsp />
His number of fleas<nbsp />
Started dropping by 3's!<nbsp /><nbsp />
Before his shampoo<nbsp />
I counted 42.<nbsp />
At the end of his bath,<nbsp />
I redid the math<nbsp />
And the new shampoo had killed 17 fleas.<nbsp />
So now I was pleased.<nbsp /><nbsp />
Now it is time for you to have some fun<nbsp />

You must help me figure out<nbsp />
Use the new shampoo or go without?</p>

        <p><em>H_{0}</em>: <m>p</m> ≤ 0.25   <em>H_{a}</em>: <m>p</m> &gt; 0.25</p>
        <p>Determine the distribution needed:</p>
        <p>In words, <em>clearly</em> state what your random variable <m>\overline{X}</m> or <m>P′</m> represents.</p>
        <p><m>P′</m> = The proportion of fleas that are killed by the new shampoo</p>

        <p>Normal:</p>
        <p>The <m>z</m>-test is given by</p>
        <p>Because this is a hypothesis test one-sided to the right, we compute the  <m>p</m>-value as the area to the right tail of the <m>z</m>-test in a standard normal distribution, <m>P(Z&gt;3.32)\approx\text{0}\text{.0103}\text{.}</m></p>
        <p>In one to two complete sentences, explain what the <m>p</m>-value means for this problem.</p>
        <p>If the null hypothesis is true (the proportion is 0.25), then there is a 0.0103 probability that the sample (estimated) proportion is 0.4048 <m>(\frac{17}{42})</m> or more.</p>
        <p>Use the previous information to sketch a picture of this situation. <em>Clearly</em> label and scale the horizontal axis and

        <p>Indicate the correct decision (<em>reject</em> or <em>do not reject</em> the null hypothesis) and the reason for it, and write an appropriate conclusion, using complete sentences.</p>
        <p>Conclusion: At the 1 percent level of significance, the sample data do not show sufficient evidence that the percentage of fleas that are killed by the new shampoo is more than 25 percent.</p>
        <p>Construct a 95 percent confidence interval for the true mean or proportion. Include a sketch of the graph of the situation.
Label the point estimate and the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.</p>
        <p>Confidence Interval: (0.26, 0.55). We are 95 percent confident that the true population proportion <m>p</m> of fleas that are killed by the new shampoo is between 26 percent and 55 percent.</p>

      <statement>
        <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides exact data on conductivity properties of materials. Following are conductivity measurements for 11 randomly selected pieces of a particular type of glass:</p>
        <p>1.11, 1.07, 1.11, 1.07, 1.12, 1.08, 0.98, 0.98, 1.02, 0.95, 0.95</p>

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>Let’s follow a four-step process to answer this statistical question.
State the question: We need to determine if, at a 0.05 significance level, the average conductivity of the selected glass is greater than one. Our hypotheses will be as follows:

<em>H_{0}</em>: <m>μ</m> ≤ 1
<em>H_{a}</em>: <m>μ</m> &gt; 1

Plan: We are testing a sample mean without a known population standard deviation. Therefore, we need to use a Student's <m>t</m>-distribution. Assume the underlying population is normal.
Do the calculations: We will input the sample data into the TI-83 as follows.


  


  


  


  



State the conclusions: Since the <m>p</m>-value (<m>p</m> = 0.036) is less than our alpha value, we will reject the null hypothesis. It is reasonable to state that the data support the claim that the average conductivity level is greater than one.</p>

        <p>In a study of 420,019 cell phone users, 172 of the subjects developed brain cancer. Test the claim that cell phone users developed brain cancer at a greater rate than that for non-cell phone users. The rate of brain cancer for non-cell phone users is 0.0340 percent. Since this is a critical issue, use a 0.005 significance level. Explain why the significance level should be so low in terms of a Type I error.</p>

          <li>We will be testing a sample proportion with <m>x</m> = 172 and <m>n</m> = 420,019. The sample is sufficiently large because we have <m>np</m> = 420,019(0.00034) = 142.8, <m>nq</m> = 420,019(0.99966) = 419,876.2, two independent outcomes, and a fixed probability of success <m>p</m> = 0.00034.

          <li>Since the <m>p</m>-value = 0.0073 is greater than our alpha value = 0.005, we cannot reject the null. Therefore, we conclude that there is not enough evidence to support the claim of higher brain cancer rates for the cell phone users.</li>

      <title>Chapter Review</title>
      <p>The <term>hypothesis test</term> itself has an established process. This can be summarized as follows:
Determine <em>H_{0}</em> and <em>H_{a}</em>. Remember, they are contradictory.
Determine the random variable.
Determine the distribution for the test.
Draw a graph, calculate the test statistic, and use the test statistic to calculate the
<m>p</m>-value. (A <m>z</m>-score and a <m>t</m>-score are examples of test statistics.)
Compare the preconceived <m>α</m> with the <m>p</m>-value, make a decision (reject or do not reject <em>H_{0}</em>), and write a clear conclusion using English sentences.</p>
      <p>Notice that in performing the hypothesis test, you use <m>α</m> and not <m>β</m>. <m>β</m> is needed to help determine the sample size of the data that are used in calculating the <m>p</m>-value. Remember that the quantity 1 – <m>β</m> is called the Power of the Test. A high power is desirable. If the power is too low, statisticians typically increase the sample size while keeping <m>α</m> the same. If the power is low, the null hypothesis might not be rejected when it should be.</p>

    <p>Studies often compare two groups. For example, researchers are interested in the effect aspirin has in preventing heart attacks. Over the last few years, newspapers and magazines have reported various aspirin studies involving two groups. Typically, one group is given aspirin and the other group is given a placebo. Then, the heart attack rate is studied over several years.</p>
    <p>There are other situations that deal with the comparison of two groups. For example, studies compare various diet and exercise programs. Politicians compare the proportion of individuals from different income brackets who might vote for them. Students are interested in whether the SAT or GRE preparatory courses really help raise their scores.</p>
    <p>You have learned to conduct hypothesis tests on single means and single proportions. You will expand upon that in this chapter. You will compare two means or two proportions to each other. The general procedure is the same, just expanded.</p>
    <p>To compare two means or two proportions, you work with two groups. The groups are classified as <em>independent groups</em> or <em>matched pairs</em>. <em>Independent groups</em> consist of two samples that are independent, that is, sample values selected from one population are not related in any way to sample values selected from the other population. <em>Matched pairs</em> consist of two samples that are dependent. The parameter tested using matched pairs is the population mean. The parameters tested using independent groups are either population means or population proportions.</p>

      <title>NOTE</title>
      <p>This chapter relies on either a calculator or a computer to calculate the degrees of freedom, the test statistics, and <m>p</m> values. TI-83+ and TI-84 instructions are included, as well as the test statistic formulas. When using a TI-83+ or TI-84 calculator, we do not need to separate two population means, independent groups, or population variances unknown into large and small sample sizes. However, most statistical computer software has the ability to differentiate these tests.</p>

          <p>In 2009, President Barack Obama announced a new national fuel economy and emissions policy for cars and light trucks. It stated that the combined fleet fuel economy for an auto manufacturer of cars and light trucks will have to average 35.5 mpg or better by 2016. From past studies on fuel economy, it is known that the standard deviation of a typical fleet is 7.6 mpg. An auto manufacturer selects a random sample of 55 cars and light trucks and finds the sample mean fuel economy to be 34.6 mpg with a standard deviation of 10.3 mpg. Can the manufacturer claim that their fleet meets the fuel economy standard in the 2016 policy at the 5 percent level?</p>

            <li>We are 95 percent confident that between 38.29 percent and 61.71 percent of family members will shed tears at a family reunion. (0.3829, 0.6171). The <em>plus-4s</em> confidence interval (see chapter 8) is (0.3861, 0.6139)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Note that here the  <em>large-sample</em> 1 – PropZTest provides the approximate <m>p</m>-value of 0.0438. Whenever a <m>p</m>-value based on a normal approximation is close to the level of significance, the exact <m>p</m>-value based on binomial probabilities should be calculated whenever possible. This is beyond the scope of this course.</p>

          <p>"Dalmatian Darnation," by Kathy Sparling</p>
          <p>A greedy dog breeder named Spreckles</p>

          <p>The Dalmatians he sought</p>
          <p>Possessed spot upon spot</p>

          <p>His competitors did not agree</p>

          <p>They said, “Spots are quite nice</p>

          <p>One should breed for improved pedigree.”<nbsp /></p>
          <p>The breeders decided to prove</p>
          <p>This strategy was a wrong move.</p>
          <p>Breeding only for spots</p>
          <p>Would wreak havoc, they thought.</p>

          <p>They proposed a contest to Spreckles</p>
          <p>Comparing dog prices to freckles.</p>
          <p>In records they looked up</p>
          <p>One hundred one pups:</p>

          <p>Said an amateur statistician</p>

        <statement>
          <p><em>Macaroni and Cheese, please!!</em> by Nedda Misherghi and Rachelle Hall</p>
          <p>As a poor starving student I don't have much money to spend for even the bare necessities. So my favorite and main staple food is macaroni and cheese. It's high in taste and low in cost and nutritional value.</p>
          <p>One day, as I sat down to determine the meaning of life, I got a serious craving for this, oh, so important, food of my life. So I went down the street to Greatway to get a box of macaroni and cheese, but it was SO expensive! $2.02 !!! Can you believe it? It made me stop and think. The world is changing fast. I had thought that the mean cost of a box (the normal size, not some super-gigantic-family-value-pack) was at most $1, but now I wasn't so sure. However, I was determined to find out. I went to 53 of the closest grocery stores and surveyed the prices of macaroni and cheese. Here are the data I wrote in my notebook:</p>
          <p>I could see that the cost varied but I had to sit down to figure out whether or not I was right. If it does turn out that this mouth-watering dish is at most $1, then I'll throw a big cheesy party in our next statistics lab, with enough macaroni and cheese for just me. After all, as a poor starving student I can't be expected to feed our class of animals!</p>

          <p>"William Shakespeare: The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark," by Jacqueline Ghodsi</p>
          <p>Scene: The great library of the castle, in which Hamlet does his lessons</p>
          <p>Act I</p>
          <p>The day is fair, but the face of Hamlet is clouded. He paces the large room. His tutor, Polonius, is reprimanding Hamlet regarding the latter’s recent experience. Horatio is seated at the large table at right stage.</p>
          <p>POLONIUS: My Lord, how cans’t thou admit that thou hast seen a ghost! It is but a figment of your imagination!</p>
          <p>HAMLET: I beg to differ; I know of a certainty that five-and-seventy in one hundred of us, condemned to the whips and scorns of time as we are, have gazed upon a spirit of health, or goblin damn’d, be their intents wicked or charitable.</p>
          <p>POLONIUS: If thou dost insist upon thy wretched vision then let me invest your time; be true to thy work and speak to me through the reason of the null and alternate hypotheses. (He turns to Horatio.) Did not Hamlet himself say, “What a piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties”? Then let not this foolishness persist. Go, Horatio, make a survey of three-and-sixty and discover what the true proportion be. For my part, I will never succumb to this fantasy, but deem man to be devoid of all reason should thy proposal of at least five-and-seventy in one hundred hold true.</p>
          <p>HORATIO (to Hamlet): What should we do, my Lord?</p>
          <p>HAMLET: Go to thy purpose, Horatio.</p>
          <p>HORATIO: To what end, my Lord?</p>
          <p>HAMLET: That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonance of our youth, but the obligation of our ever-preserved love, be even and direct with me, whether I am right or no.</p>
          <p>Horatio exits, followed by Polonius, leaving Hamlet to ponder alone.</p>
          <p>Act II</p>
          <p>The next day, Hamlet awaits anxiously the presence of his friend, Horatio. Polonius enters and places some books upon the table just a moment before Horatio enters.</p>
          <p>POLONIUS: So, Horatio, what is it thou didst reveal through thy deliberations?</p>
          <p>HORATIO: In a random survey, for which purpose thou thyself sent me forth, I did discover that one-and-forty believe fervently that the spirits of the dead walk with us. Before my God, I might not this believe, without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes.</p>
          <p>POLONIUS: Give thine own thoughts no tongue, Horatio. (Polonius turns to Hamlet.) But look to’t I charge you, my Lord. Come Horatio, let us go together, for this is not our test. (Horatio and Polonius leave together.)</p>
          <p>HAMLET: To reject, or not reject, that is the question: whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous statistics, or to take arms against a sea of data, and, by opposing, end them. (Hamlet resignedly attends to his task.)</p>

          <p>"Untitled," by Stephen Chen</p>
          <p>I've often wondered how software is released and sold to the public. Ironically, I work for a company that sells products with known problems. Unfortunately, most of the problems are difficult to create, which makes them difficult to fix. I usually use the test program X, which tests the product, to try to create a specific problem. When the test program is run to make an error occur, the likelihood of generating an error is 1 percent.</p>
          <p>So, armed with this knowledge, I wrote a new test program Y that will generate the same error that test program X creates, but more often. To find out if my test program is better than the original, so that I can convince the management that I'm right, I ran my test program to find out how often I can generate the same error. When I ran my test program 50 times, I generated the error twice. While this may not seem much better, I think that I can convince the management to use my test program instead of the original test program. Am I right?</p>

          <p>"Japanese Girls’ Names"</p>
          <p>by Kumi Furuichi</p>
          <p>It used to be very typical for Japanese girls’ names to end with “ko.” The trend might have started around my grandmothers’ generation and its peak might have been around my mother’s generation. “Ko” means “child” in Chinese characters. Parents would name their daughters with “ko” attaching to other Chinese characters that have meanings that they want their daughters to become, such as Sachiko—happy child, Yoshiko—a good child, Yasuko—a healthy child, and so on.</p>
          <p>However, I noticed recently that only two out of nine of my Japanese girlfriends at this school have names that end with “ko.” More and more, parents seem to have become creative, modernized, and, sometimes, westernized in naming their children.</p>
          <p>I have a feeling that, while 70 percent or more of my mother’s generation would have names with “ko” at the end, the proportion has dropped among my peers. I wrote down all my Japanese friends’, ex-classmates’, coworkers’, and acquaintances’ names that I could remember. Following are the names. Some are repeats. Test to see if the proportion has dropped for this generation.</p>

        <statement>
          <p>The student academic group on a college campus claims that freshman students study at least 2.5 hours per day, on average. One Introduction to Statistics class was skeptical. The class took a random sample of 30 freshman students and found a mean study time of 137 minutes with a standard deviation of 45 minutes. At <m>α</m> = 0.01 level, is the student academic group’s claim correct?</p>

            <li>At the 1 percent significance level, there is not enough evidence to conclude that freshmen students study less than 2.5 hours per day, on average.</li>
