      <title>Chapter Objectives</title>
      <p>By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognize and understand continuous probability density functions in general</li>
        <li>Recognize the uniform probability distribution and apply it appropriately</li>
        <li>Recognize the exponential probability distribution and apply it appropriately</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>

    <p>Continuous random variables have many applications. Baseball batting averages, IQ scores, the length of time a long-distance telephone call lasts, the amount of money a person carries, the length of time a computer chip lasts, and SAT scores are just a few. The field of reliability depends on a variety of continuous random variables.</p>

    <note xml:id="note-ch05-intro">
      <title>Note</title>
      <p>The values of discrete and continuous random variables can be ambiguous. For example, if <em>X</em> is equal to the number of miles (to the nearest mile) you drive to work, then <em>X</em> is a discrete random variable. You count the miles. If <em>X</em> is the distance you drive to work, then you measure values of <em>X</em> and <em>X</em> is a continuous random variable. For a second example, if <em>X</em> is equal to the number of books in a backpack, then <em>X</em> is a discrete random variable. If <em>X</em> is the weight of a book, then <em>X</em> is a continuous random variable because weights are measured. How the random variable is defined is very important.</p>

      <title>Properties of Continuous Probability Distributions</title>
      
      <p>The graph of a continuous probability distribution is a curve. Probability is represented by the area under the curve.</p>

      <p>The curve is called the <term xml:id="term-probability-density-function">probability density function</term> (abbreviated as <em>pdf</em>). We use the symbol <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) to represent the curve. <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) is the function that corresponds to the graph; we use the density function <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) to draw the graph of the probability distribution.</p>

      <p><em>Area under the curve</em> is given by a different function called the  <em>cumulative distribution function</em> (abbreviated as <em>cdf</em>). The cumulative distribution function is used to evaluate probability as area.</p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>The outcomes are measured, not counted.</li>
          <li>The entire area under the curve and above the <em>x</em>-axis is equal to one.</li>
          <li>Probability is found for intervals of <em>x</em> values rather than for individual <em>x</em> values.</li>
          <li><em>P(c &lt; x &lt; d)</em> is the probability that the random variable <em>X</em> is in the interval between the values <em>c</em> and <em>d</em>. <em>P(c &lt; x &lt; d)</em> is the area under the curve, above the <em>x</em>-axis, to the right of <em>c</em> and the left of <em>d</em>.</li>
          <li><em>P(x = c) =</em> 0 The probability that <em>x</em> takes on any single individual value is zero. The area below the curve, above the <em>x</em>-axis, and between <em>x</em> = <em>c</em> and <em>x</em> = <em>c</em> has no width, and therefore no area (area = 0). Since the probability is equal to the area, the probability is also zero.</li>
          <li><em>P(c &lt; x &lt; d)</em> is the same as <em>P(c ≤ x ≤ d)</em> because probability is equal to area.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>We will find the area that represents probability by using geometry, formulas, technology, or probability tables. In general, calculus is needed to find the area under the curve for many probability density functions. When we use formulas to find the area in this textbook, we are using formulas that were found by using the techniques of integral calculus. However, because most students taking this course have not studied calculus, we will not be using calculus in this textbook.</p>

      <p>There are many continuous probability distributions. When probability is modeled by use of a continuous probability distribution, the distribution used is selected to model and fit the particular situation in the best way.</p>

      <p>In this chapter and the next, we will study the uniform distribution, the exponential distribution, and the normal distribution. The following graphs illustrate these distributions:</p>

      <title>Continuous Probability Density Functions</title>

      <p>We begin by defining a continuous probability density function. We use the function notation <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>). Intermediate algebra may have been your first formal introduction to functions. In the study of probability, the functions we study are special. We define the function <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) so that the area between it and the <em>x</em>-axis is equal to a probability. Since the maximum probability is one, the maximum area is also one. <em>For continuous probability distributions, PROBABILITY = AREA.</em></p>

The graph of <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <m>\frac{1}{20}</m> is a horizontal line. However, since 0 ≤ <em>x</em> ≤ 20, <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) is restricted to the portion between <em>x</em> = 0 and <em>x</em> = 20, inclusive.</p>

          <p>The area corresponds to a probability. The probability that <em>x</em> is between zero and two is 0.1, which can be written mathematically as <em>P</em>(0 &lt; <em>x</em> &lt; 2) = <em>P</em>(<em>x</em> &lt; 2) = 0.1.</p>

Notice the <em>less than or equal to</em> symbol. We can also use the CDF to calculate <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> > <em>x</em>). The CDF gives <em>area to the left</em> and <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> > <em>x</em>) gives <em>area to the right</em>. We calculate <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> > <em>x</em>) for continuous distributions as follows: <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> > <em>x</em>) = 1 – <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> &lt; <em>x</em>).</p>

      <p>The probability density function (pdf) is used to describe probabilities for continuous random variables. The area under the density curve between two points corresponds to the probability that the variable falls between those two values. In other words, the area under the density curve between points <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> is equal to <em>P</em>(<em>a</em> &lt; <em>x</em> &lt; <em>b</em>). The cumulative distribution function (cdf) gives the probability as an area. If <em>X</em> is a continuous random variable, the probability density function (pdf), <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>), is used to draw the graph of the probability distribution. The total area under the graph of <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) is one. The area under the graph of <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) and between values <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> gives the probability <em>P</em>(<em>a</em> &lt; <em>x</em> &lt; <em>b</em>).</p>

<section xml:id="sec-exponential-distribution">
<p xml:id="fs-idm32858512">The <term xml:id="term-00001">exponential distribution</term> is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs. For example, the amount of time (beginning now) until an earthquake occurs has an exponential distribution. Other examples include the length, in minutes, of long-distance business telephone calls, and the amount of time, in months, a car battery lasts. It can be shown, too, that the value of the change that you have in your pocket or purse approximately follows an exponential distribution.</p>
<p xml:id="fs-idp21035296">Values for an exponential random variable occur in the following way. There are fewer large values and more small values.

<title>Memorylessness of the Exponential Distribution</title>
<p xml:id="fs-idm15452368">In <xref ref="fs-idp58220144"/> recall that the amount of time between customers is exponentially distributed with a mean of two minutes (<em>X</em> ~ <em>Exp</em>(0.5)). Suppose that five minutes have elapsed since the last customer arrived. Since an unusually long amount of time has now elapsed, it would seem to be more likely for a customer to arrive within the next minute. With the exponential distribution, this is not the case—the additional time spent waiting for the next customer does not depend on how much time has already elapsed since the last customer. This is referred to as the memoryless property. Specifically, the memoryless property says the following</p>

The memoryless property says that knowledge of what has occurred in the past has no effect on future probabilities. In this case it means that an old part is not any more likely to break down at any particular time than a brand new part. In other words, the part stays as good as new until it suddenly breaks. For example, if the part has already lasted ten years, then the probability that it lasts another seven years is <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> &gt; 17|<em>X</em> &gt; 10) = <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> &gt; 7) = 0.4966.</p>

If these assumptions hold, then the number of events per unit time follows a Poisson distribution with mean <em>λ</em> = 1/μ.

Notice that by the rule of complement events, <em>P</em>(<em>T</em> &lt; 8|<em>T</em> &gt; 7) = 1 – <em>P</em>(<em>T</em> &gt; 8|<em>T</em> &gt; 7).
By the memoryless property (<em>P</em>(<em>X</em> &gt; <em>r</em> + <em>t</em>|<em>X</em> &gt; <em>r</em>) = <em>P</em>(<em>X</em> &gt; <em>t</em>)).
