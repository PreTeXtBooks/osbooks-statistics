      <title>Chapter Objectives</title>
      <p>By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognize and understand discrete probability distribution functions, in general.</li>
        <li>Calculate and interpret expected values.</li>
        <li>Recognize the binomial probability distribution and apply it appropriately.</li>
        <li>Recognize the Poisson probability distribution and apply it appropriately.</li>
        <li>Recognize the geometric probability distribution and apply it appropriately.</li>
        <li>Recognize the hypergeometric probability distribution and apply it appropriately.</li>
        <li>Classify discrete word problems by their distributions.</li>
      </ul>
    </note>
    <p>A student takes a 10-question, true-false quiz. Because the student had such a busy schedule, he or she could not study and guesses randomly at each answer. What is the probability of the student passing the test with at least a 70 percent?</p>
    <p>Small companies might be interested in the number of long-distance phone calls their employees make during the peak time of the day. Suppose the average is 20 calls. What is the probability that the employees make more than 20 long-distance phone calls during the peak time?</p>
    <p>These two examples illustrate two different types of probability problems involving discrete random variables. Recall that discrete data are data that you can count. A random variable is a variable whose values are numerical outcome of a probability experiment. We always describe a random variable in words and its values in numbers. The values of a random variable can vary with each repetition of an experiment.</p>

    <title>Random Variable Notation</title>
    <p>Uppercase letters such as <m>X</m> or <m>Y</m> denote a random variable. Lowercase letters like <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> denote the value of a random variable. If  <m>X</m> is a random variable, then <m>X</m> is written in words, and <m>x</m> is given as a number.</p>
    <p>The following are examples of random variables:</p>
    <p>Example 1: Suppose a jar contains three marbles, one blue, one red, and one white. Randomly draw one marble from the jar. Let <m>X</m> = the possible number of red marbles to be drawn. The sample space for the drawing is red, white, and blue. Then, <m>x</m> = 0,1. If the marble we draw is red, then <m>x</m> = 1; otherwise, <m>x</m> = 0.</p>
    <p>Example 2: Let <m>X</m> = the number of female children in a randomly selected family with only two kids. Here we are only interested in families with two kids, not families with one kid or more than two kids. The sample space for the genders of two-kid families is <em>MM, MF, FM, FF</em>. Here the first letter represents the gender of the older child and the second letter represents the gender of the younger child. F represents a female child and M represents a male child. For example, FM represents that the older child is a girl and the younger child is a boy, while MF represents that the older child is a boy and the younger child is a girl. Then, <m>x</m> = 0,1,2. A family has 0 female children if it has two boys (MM), a family has one female child if it has one boy and one girl (MF or FM), and a family has two female children if both kids are girls (FF).</p>
    <p>Example 3: Let <m>X</m> = the number of heads you get when you toss three fair coins. The sample space for the toss of three fair coins is <em>TTT, THH, HTH, HHT, HTT, THT, TTH, HHH</em>. Here the first letter represents the result of the first toss, the second letter represents the result of the second toss, and the third letter represents the result of the third toss. T represents a tail and H represents a head. For example, THH means we get a tail in the first toss but a head in the second and third toss, while HHT means we get a head in the first and second toss but a tail in the third toss. Then, <m>x</m> = 0, 1, 2, 3. There are 0 heads if the result is TTT, one head if the result is THT, TTH, or HTT, two heads if the result is THH, HTH, or HHT, and three heads if the result is HHH.</p>
    <note xml:id="fs-idp37582368">
      <p>Toss a coin 10 times and record the number of heads. After all members of the class have completed the experiment (tossed a coin 10 times and counted the number of heads), fill in . Let <m>X</m> = the number of heads in 10 tosses of the coin.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Which value(s) of <m>x</m> occurred most frequently?</li>
        <li>If you tossed the coin 1,000 times, what values could <m>x</m> take on? Which value(s) of <m>x</m> do you think would occur most frequently?</li>
        <li>What does the relative frequency column sum to?</li>

      <p>There are two types of <term>random variables</term>, discrete random variables and continuous random variables. The values of a <em>discrete random variable</em> are countable, which means the values are obtained by counting. All random variables we discussed in previous examples are discrete random variables. We counted the number of red balls, the number of heads, or the number of female children to get the corresponding random variable values. The values of a <em>continuous random variable</em> are uncountable, which means the values are not obtained by counting. Instead, they are obtained by measuring. For example, let <m>X</m> = temperature of a randomly selected day in June in a city. The value of <m>X</m> can be 68°, 71.5°, 80.6°, or 90.32°. These values are obtained by measuring by a thermometer. Another example of a continuous random variable is the height of a randomly selected high school student. The value of this random variable can be 5'2", 6'1", or 5'8". Those values are obtained by measuring by a ruler.</p>
      <p>A discrete <term>probability distribution function</term> has two characteristics:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Each probability is between zero and one, inclusive.</li>
        <li>The sum of the probabilities is one.</li>
      </ol>
      <example xml:id="example1">
        <statement>
          <p>A child psychologist is interested in the number of times a newborn baby's crying wakes its mother after midnight. For a random sample of 50 mothers, the following information was obtained. Let <m>X</m> = the number of times per week a newborn baby's crying wakes its mother after midnight. For this example, <m>x</m> = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
          <p><m>P</m>(<m>x</m>) = probability that <m>X</m> takes on a value <m>x</m>.</p>
          <p><m>X</m> takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This is a discrete PDF because we can count the number of values of <m>x</m> and also because of the following two reasons:</p>

    <title>Mean or Expected Value and Standard Deviation</title>


    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164967836938">
      <p>The <term>expected value</term> of a discrete random variable  <m>X</m>, symbolized as <em>E(X)</em>, is often referred to as the <em>long-term average or <term>mean</term></em> (symbolized as <m>μ</m>). This means that over the long term of doing an experiment over and over, you would expect this average. For example, let <m>X</m> = the number of heads you get when you toss three fair coins. If you repeat this experiment (toss three fair coins) a large number of times, the expected value of <m>X</m> is the number of heads you expect to get for each three tosses on average.</p>
      <note xml:id="id8737934">
        <title>NOTE</title>
        <p>To find the expected value, <em>E(X)</em>,  or mean <m>μ</m> of a discrete random variable  <m>X</m>, simply multiply each value of the random variable by its probability and add the products. The formula is given as
<m>E(X)=\mu=∑xP(x)\text{.}</m></p>
        <p>Here <m>x</m> represents values of the random variable <m>X</m>, <m>P</m>(<m>x</m>) represents the corresponding probability, and symbol <m>∑</m> represents the sum of all products <m>x</m><m>P</m>(<m>x</m>). Here we use symbol <m>μ</m> for the mean because it is a parameter. It represents the mean of a population.</p>

      <example xml:id="fs-idp56252608">
        <statement>
          <title>Expected Value Table</title>
          <p>A men's soccer team plays soccer zero, one, or two days a week. The probability that they play zero days is .2, the probability that they play one day is .5, and the probability that they play two days is .3. Find the long-term average or expected value, <m>μ</m>, of the number of days per week the men's soccer team plays soccer.</p>
          <p>To do the problem, first let the random variable <m>X</m> = the number of days the men's soccer team plays soccer per week. <m>X</m> takes on the values 0, 1, 2. Construct a PDF table adding a column <em>x*P(x)</em>, the product of the value <m>x</m> with the corresponding probability <em>P(x)</em>. In this column, you will multiply each <m>x</m> value by its probability.</p>
          <p>Add the last column <m>x*P(x)</m> to get the expected value/mean of the random variable <m>X</m>.</p>
          <me>E(X)=\mu=∑xP(x)=0+.5+.6=1.1</me>
          <p>The expected value/mean is 1.1. The men's soccer team would, on the average, expect to play soccer 1.1 days per week. The number 1.1 is the long-term average or expected value if the men's soccer team plays soccer week after week after week.</p>
        </statement>
      </example>
      <p>As you learned in <xref ref="ch03-probability-topics">Chapter 3</xref>, if you toss a fair coin, the probability that the result is heads is 0.5. This probability is a theoretical probability, which is what we expect to happen. This probability does not describe the short-term results of an experiment. If you flip a coin two times, the probability does not tell you that these flips will result in one head and one tail. Even if you flip a coin 10 times or 100 times, the probability does not tell you that you will get half tails and half heads. The probability gives information about what can be expected in the long term. To demonstrate this, Karl Pearson once tossed a fair coin 24,000 times! He recorded the results of each toss, obtaining heads 12,012 times. The relative frequency of heads is 12,012/24,000 = .5005, which is very close to the theoretical probability .5. In his experiment, Pearson illustrated the law of large numbers.</p>
      <p>The law of large numbers states that, as the number of trials in a probability experiment increases, the difference between the theoretical probability of an event and the relative frequency approaches zero (the theoretical probability and the relative frequency get closer and closer together). The relative frequency is also called the experimental probability, a term that means what actually happens.</p>
      <p>In the next example, we will demonstrate how to find the expected value and <term>standard deviation of a discrete probability distribution</term> by using relative frequency.</p>
      <p>Like data, probability distributions have variances and standard deviations. The variance of a probability distribution is symbolized as <m>\sigma^{2}</m> and the standard deviation of a probability distribution is symbolized as <m>σ</m>. Both are parameters since they summarize information about a population. To find the variance <m>\sigma^{2}</m> of a discrete probability distribution, find each deviation from its expected value, square it, multiply it by its probability, and add the products. To find the standard deviation <m>σ</m> of a probability distribution, simply take the square root of variance <m>\sigma^{2}</m>. The formulas are given as below.</p>

        <statement>
          <p>A researcher conducted a study to investigate how a newborn babys crying after midnight affects the sleep of the baby's mother. The researcher randomly selected 50 new mothers and asked how many times they were awakened by their newborn baby's crying after midnight per week. Two mothers were awakened zero times, 11 mothers were awakened one time, 23 mothers were awakened two times, nine mothers were awakened three times, four mothers were awakened four times, and one mother was awakened five times. Find the expected value of the number of times a newborn baby's crying wakes its mother after midnight per week. Calculate the standard deviation of the variable as well.</p>
          <p>To do the problem, first let the random variable <m>X</m> = the number of times a mother is awakened by her newborns crying after midnight per week. <m>X</m> takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Construct a PDF table as below. The column of <m>P</m>(<m>x</m>)  gives the experimental probability of each <m>x</m> value. We will use the relative frequency to get the probability. For example, the probability that a mother wakes up zero times is <m>\frac{2}{50}</m> since there are two mothers out of 50 who were awakened zero times. The third column of the table is the product of a value and its probability, <m>x</m><m>P</m>(<m>x</m>).</p>
          <p>We then add all the products in the third column to get the mean/expected value of <m>X</m>.</p>
          <me>E(X)=\mu=∑xP(x)=0+\frac{11}{50}+\frac{46}{50}+\frac{27}{50}+\frac{16}{50}+\frac{5}{50}=\frac{105}{50}=2.1</me>
          <p>Therefore, we expect a newborn to wake its mother after midnight 2.1 times per week, on the average.</p>
          <p>To calculate the standard deviation <m>σ</m>, we add the fourth column (<em>x-μ</em>)^{2} and the fifth column <m>(x-\mu)^{2}∙P(x)</m> to get the following table:</p>
          <p>We then add all the products in the 5^{th} column to get the variance of <m>X</m>.</p>
          <me>\sigma^{2}=.1764+.2662+.0046+.1458+.2888+.1682=1.05</me>
          <p>To get the standard deviation <m>σ</m>, we simply take the square root of variance <m>σ</m>^{2}.</p>
          <me>\sigma=\sqrt{\sigma^{2}}=\sqrt{1.05}\approx1.0247</me>

      <example xml:id="element-116">
        <statement>
          <p>Suppose you play a game of chance in which five numbers are chosen from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. A computer randomly selects five numbers from zero to nine with replacement. You pay $2 to play and could profit $100,000 if you match all five numbers in order (you get your $2 back plus $100,000). Over the long term, what is your <em>expected</em> profit of playing the game?</p>
          <p>To do this problem, set up a PDF table for the amount of money you can profit.</p>
          <p>Let <m>X</m> = the amount of money you profit. If your five numbers match in order, you will win the game and will get your $2 back plus $100,000. That means your profit is $100,000. If your five numbers do not match in order, you will lose the game and lose your $2. That means your profit is -$2. Therefore, X takes on the values $100,000 and –$2. That is the second column <m>x</m> in the PDF table below.</p>
          <p>To win, you must get all five numbers correct, in order. The probability of choosing the correct first number is <m>\frac{1}{10}</m>
 because there are 10 numbers (from zero to nine) and only one of them is correct. The probability of choosing the correct second number is also <m>\frac{1}{10}</m>
 because the selection is done with replacement and there are still 10 numbers (from zero to nine) for you to choose. Due to the same reason, the probability of choosing the correct third number, the correct fourth number, and the correct fifth number are also <m>\frac{1}{10}</m>
. The selection of one number does not affect the selection of another number. That means the five selections are independent. The probability of choosing all five correct numbers and in order is equal to the product of the probabilities of choosing each number correctly.</p>
          <me>\text{P}(\text{choosing all five numbers correctly})•\text{P}(\text{choosing 1st number correctly})• \\ \text{P}(\text{choosing 2nd number correctly})•\text{P}(\text{choosing 5th number correctly}) \\ =(\frac{1}{10})•(\frac{1}{10})•(\frac{1}{10})•(\frac{1}{10})•(\frac{1}{10}) \\ =.00001</me>
          <p>Therefore, the probability of winning is .00001 and the probability of losing is 1 − .00001 = .99999. That is how we get the third column <m>P</m>(<m>x</m>) in the PDF table below.</p>
          <p>To get the fourth column <m>x</m><m>P</m>(<m>x</m>) in the table, we simply multiply the value <m>x</m> with the corresponding probability <m>P</m>(<m>x</m>).</p>
          <p>The PDF table is as follows:</p>
          <p>We then add all the products in the last column to get the mean/expected value of <m>X</m>.</p>
          <me>E(X)=\mu=∑xP(x)=-1.99998+1=-.9998\text{.}</me>
          <p>Since –.99998 is about –1, you would, on average, expect to lose approximately $1 for each game you play. However, each time you play, you either lose $2 or profit $100,000. The $1 is the average or expected loss per game after playing this game over and over.</p>

          <p>Let <m>X</m> = the amount of money you profit. The <m>x</m>-values are –$1 and $256.</p>
          <p>The probability of guessing the right suit each time is <m>(\frac{1}{4})(\frac{1}{4})(\frac{1}{4})(\frac{1}{4})=\frac{1}{256}</m> = 0.0039</p>
          <p>The probability of losing is 1 – <m>\frac{1}{256}</m> = <m>\frac{255}{256}</m> = 0.9961</p>

      <p>Generally for probability distributions, we use a calculator or a computer to calculate <m>μ</m> and <m>σ</m> to reduce rounding errors. For some probability distributions, there are shortcut formulas for calculating <m>μ</m> and <m>σ</m>.</p>

        <solution>
          <p>Tossing one fair six-sided die twice has the same sample space as tossing two fair six-sided dice. The sample space has 36 outcomes.</p>

      <p>Some of the more common discrete probability functions are binomial, geometric, hypergeometric, and Poisson. Most elementary courses do not cover the geometric, hypergeometric, and Poisson. Your instructor will let you know if he or she wishes to cover these distributions.</p>
      <p>A probability distribution function is a pattern. You try to fit a probability problem into a pattern or distribution in order to perform the necessary calculations. These distributions are tools to make solving probability problems easier. Each distribution has its own special characteristics. Learning the characteristics enables you to distinguish among the different distributions.</p>

    <title>Binomial Distribution</title>


    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164966556607">
      <p>There are three characteristics of a binomial experiment:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>There are a fixed number of trials. Think of trials as repetitions of an experiment. The letter <m>n</m> denotes the number of trials.</li>
        <li>There are only two possible outcomes, called <em>success</em> and <em>failure</em>, for each trial. The outcome that we are measuring is defined as a <em>success</em>, while the other outcome is defined as a <em>failure</em>. The letter <m>p</m> denotes the probability of a success on one trial, and <m>q</m> denotes the probability of a failure on one trial. <m>p</m> + <m>q</m> = 1.</li>
        <li>The <m>n</m> trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions. Because the <m>n</m> trials are independent, the outcome of one trial does not help in predicting the outcome of another trial. Another way of saying this is that for each individual trial, the probability, <m>p</m>, of a success and probability, <m>q</m>, of a failure remain the same.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Let us look at several examples of a binomial experiment.</p>
      <p>Example 1: Toss a fair coin once and record the result.</p>
      <p>This is a binomial experiment since it meets all three characteristics. The number of trials <m>n</m> = 1. There are only two outcomes, a head or a tail, of each trial. We can define a head as a success if we are measuring number of heads. For a fair coin, the probabilities of getting head or tail are both .5. So, <m>p</m> = <m>q</m> − .5. Both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> remain the same from trial to trial. This experiment is also called a Bernoulli trial, named after Jacob Bernoulli who, in the late 1600s, studied such trials extensively. Any experiment that has characteristics two and three and where <m>n</m> = 1 is called a Bernoulli trial. A binomial experiment takes place when the number of successes is counted in one or more Bernoulli trials.</p>
      <p>Example 2: Randomly guess a multiple choice question has A, B, C and D four options.</p>
      <p>This is a binomial experiment since it meets all three characteristics. The number of trials <m>n</m> = 1. There are only two outcomes, guess correctly or guess wrong, of each trial. We can define guess correctly as a success. For a random guess (you have no clue at all), the probability of guessing correct should be <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> because there are four options and only one option is correct. So,  and <m>p=\frac{1}{4}</m> and <m>q=1-p=1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}</m>. Both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> remain the same from trial to trial. This experiment is also a Bernoulli trial. It meets the characteristics two and three and <m>n</m> = 1.</p>
      <p>Example 3: Toss a fair coin five times and record the result.</p>
      <p>This is a binomial experiment since it meets all three characteristics. The number of trials <m>n</m> = 5. There are only two outcomes, head or tail, of each trial. If we define head as a success, then <m>p</m> = <m>q</m> = 0.5. Both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> remain the same for each trial. Since n = 5, this experiment is not a Bernoulli trial although it meets the characteristics two and three.</p>
      <p>Example 4: Randomly guess 10 multiple choice questions in an exam. Each question has A, B, C and D four options.</p>
      <p>This is a binomial experiment since it meets all three characteristics. The number of trials <m>n</m> = 10. There are only two outcomes, guess correctly or guess wrong, of each trial. We can define guess correctly as a success. As we explained in example 2, <m>p=\frac{1}{4}</m> and  <m>q=1-p=1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}</m>. Both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> remain the same for each guess. Since <m>n</m> = 10, this experiment is not a Bernoulli trial.</p>
      <p>The next two experiments are not binomial experiments.</p>
      <p>Example 5: Randomly select two balls from a jar with five red balls and five blue balls without replacement. This means we select the first ball, and then without returning the selected ball into the jar, we will select the second ball.</p>
      <p>This is not a binomial experiment since the third characteristic is not met. The number of trials <m>n</m> = 2. There are only two outcomes, a red ball or a blue ball, of each trial. If we define selecting a red ball as a success, then selecting a blue ball is a failure. The probability of getting the first ball red is <m>\frac{5}{10}</m> since there are five red balls out of 10 balls. So, <m>p=\frac{5}{10}</m> and <m>q=1-p=1-\frac{5}{10}=\frac{5}{10}</m>. However, <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> do not remain the same for the second trial. If the first ball selected is red, then the probability of getting the second ball red is <m>\frac{4}{9}</m> since there are only four red balls out of nine balls. But if the first ball selected is blue, then the probability of getting the second ball red is <m>\frac{5}{9}</m> since there are still five red balls out of nine balls.</p>
      <p>Example 6: Toss a fair coin until a head appears.</p>
      <p>This is not a binomial experiment since the first characteristic is not met. The number of trials <m>n</m> is not fixed. <m>n</m> could be 1 if a head appears from the first toss. <m>n</m> could be 2 if the first toss is a tail and the second toss is a head. So on and so forth.</p>
      <p>More examples of binomial and non-binomial experiments will be discussed in this section later.</p>
      <p>The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a <term>binomial probability distribution</term>. The random variable <m>X</m> = the number of successes obtained in the <m>n</m> independent trials.</p>
      <p>There are shortcut formulas for calculating mean <m>μ</m>, variance <m>σ</m>^{2}, and standard deviation <m>σ</m> of a binomial probability distribution. The formulas are given as below. The deriving of these formulas will not be discussed in this book.</p>
      <me>\mu=np,\sigma^{2}=npq,\sigma=\sqrt{npq}\text{.}</me>
      <p>Here <m>n</m> is the number of trials, <m>p</m> is the probability of a success, and <m>q</m> is the probability of a failure.</p>

        <statement>
          <p>At ABC High School, the withdrawal rate from an elementary physics course is 30 percent for any given term. This implies that, for any given term, 70 percent of the students stay in the class for the entire term. The random variable <m>X</m> = the number of students who withdraw from the randomly selected elementary physics class. Since we are measuring the number of students who withdrew, a <em>success</em> is defined as an individual who withdrew.</p>

        <statement>
          <p>Suppose you play a game that you can only either win or lose. The probability that you win any game is 55 percent, and the probability that you lose is 45 percent. Each game you play is independent. If you play the game 20 times, write the function that describes the probability that you win 15 of the 20 times. Here, if you define <m>X</m> as the number of wins, then <m>X</m> takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, . . ., 20. The probability of a success is <m>p</m> = 0.55. The probability of a failure is <m>q</m> = .45. The number of trials is <m>n</m> = 20. The probability question can be stated mathematically as <m>P</m>(<m>x</m> = 15). If you define <m>X</m> as the number of losses, then a <em>success</em> is defined as a loss and a <em>failure</em> is defined as a win. A <em>success</em> does not necessarily represent a good outcome. It is simply the outcome that you are measuring. <m>X</m> still takes on the values of 0, 1, 2, 3, . . ., 20.

        <title>NOTE</title>
        <p>It has been stated that about 41 percent of adult workers have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education. If 20 adult workers are randomly selected, find the probability that at most 12 of them have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education. How many adult workers do you expect to have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education?</p>
        <p>Let <m>X</m> = the number of workers who have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education.</p>
        <p><m>X</m> takes on the values 0, 1, 2, . . ., 20 where <m>n</m> = 20, <m>p</m> = .41, and <m>q</m> = 1 – .41 = .59. <m>X</m> ~ <m>B</m>(20, .41)</p>
        <p>Find <m>P</m>(<m>x</m> ≤ 12). There is a formula to define the probability of a binomial distribution <m>P</m>(<m>x</m>). We can use the formula to find <m>P(x\leq12)</m>. But the calculation is tedious and time consuming, and people usually use a graphing calculator, software, or binomial table to get the answer. Use a graphing calculator, you can get <m>P(x\leq12)=.9738</m>. The instruction of TI-83, 83+, 84, 84+ is given below.</p>
        <p>The probability that at most 12 workers have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education is .9738.</p>
        <p>The graph of <m>X</m> ~ <m>B</m>(20, .41) is as follows.</p>
        <p>The previous graph is called a probability distribution histogram. It is made of a series of vertical bars. The <m>x</m>-axis of each bar is the value of <m>X</m> = the number of workers who have only a high school diploma, and the height of that bar is the probability of that value occurring.</p>
        <p>The number of adult workers that you expect to have a high school diploma but not pursue any further education is the mean, <m>μ</m> = <m>np</m> = (20)(.41) = 8.2.</p>
        <p>The formula for the variance is σ^{2} = <em>npq</em>. The standard deviation is <m>σ</m> = <m>\sqrt{npq}</m>. <nbsp/><m>σ</m> = <m>\sqrt{(20)(.41)(.59)}</m> = 2.20.</p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>The following is the interpretation of the mean <m>\mu=8.2</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma=2.20</m>:</p>
    <p>If you randomly select 20 adult workers, and do that over and over, you expect around eight adult workers out of 20 to have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education on average. And you expect that to vary by about two workers on average.</p>

          <li><m>x</m> = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8</li>
          <li>This is a binomial experiment since all three characteristics are met. Each page is a trial. Since we sample 100 pages, the number of trials is <m>n</m> = 100. For each page, there are two possible outcomes, features signature artists or does not feature signature artists. Since we are measuring the number of pages that feature signature artists, a page that features signature artists is defined as a success and a page that does not feature signature artists is defined as a failure. There are 8 out of 560 pages that feature signature artists. Therefore the probability of a success <m>p=\frac{8}{560}</m> and the probability of a failure <m>q=1-p=1-\frac{8}{560}=\frac{552}{560}</m>.<nbsp/><nbsp/>
Both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> remain the same for each page. Therefore, <m>X</m> is a binomial random variable, and it can be written as <m>X\simB(100,\frac{8}{560})</m>.<nbsp/><nbsp/>

ABC High School has a student advisory committee made up of 10 staff members and six students. The committee wishes to choose a chairperson and a recorder. What is the probability that the chairperson and recorder are both students? The names of all committee members are put into a box, and two names are drawn <em>without replacement</em>. The first name drawn determines the chairperson and the second name the recorder. There are two trials. However, the trials are not independent because the outcome of the first trial affects the outcome of the second trial. The probability of a student on the first draw is <m>\frac{6}{16}</m> because there are six students out of 16 members (10 staff members + six students). If the first draw selects a student, then the probability of a student on the second draw is <m>\frac{5}{16}</m> because there are only five students out of 15 members. If the first draw selects a staff member, then the probability of a student on the second draw is <m>\frac{6}{15}</m> because there are still six students out of 15 members. The probability of drawing a student's name changes for each of the trials and, therefore, violates the condition of independence.</p>

    <title>Geometric Distribution</title>


    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164965552033">
      <p>There are three main characteristics of a <term>geometric experiment</term>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Repeating independent Bernoulli trials until a success is obtained. Recall that a Bernoulli trial is a binomial experiment with number of trials <m>n</m> = 1. In other words, you keep repeating what you are doing until the first success. Then you stop. For example, you throw a dart at a bull's-eye until you hit the bull's-eye. The first time you hit the bull's-eye is a <em>success</em> so you stop throwing the dart. It might take six tries until you hit the bull's-eye. You can think of the trials as failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, success, stop.</li>
        <li>In theory, the number of trials could go on forever. There must be at least one trial.</li>
        <li>The probability, <m>p</m>, of a success and the probability, <m>q</m>, of a failure do not change from trial to trial. <m>p</m> + <m>q</m> = 1 and <m>q</m> = 1 − <m>p</m>. For example, the probability of rolling a three when you throw one fair die is <m>\frac{1}{6}</m>. This is true no matter how many times you roll the die. Suppose you want to know the probability of getting the first three on the fifth roll. On rolls one through four, you do not get a face with a three. The probability for each of the rolls is <m>q</m> = <m>\frac{5}{6}</m>, the probability of a failure. The probability of getting a three on the fifth roll is <m>(\frac{5}{6})(\frac{5}{6})(\frac{5}{6})(\frac{5}{6})(\frac{1}{6})</m> = .0804.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><m>X</m> = the number of independent trials until the first success.</p>
      <p><m>p</m> = the probability of a success, <m>q</m> = 1  <m>p</m> = the probability of a failure.</p>
      <p>There are shortcut formulas for calculating mean <m>μ</m>, variance <m>σ</m>^{2}, and standard deviation <m>σ</m> of a geometric probability distribution. The formulas are given as below. The deriving of these formulas will not be discussed in this book.</p>
      <me>\mu=\frac{1}{p},\sigma^{2}=(\frac{1}{p})(\frac{1}{p}-1),\sigma=\sqrt{(\frac{1}{p})(\frac{1}{p}-1)}</me>
      <example xml:id="element-328">
        <statement>
          <p>Suppose a game has two outcomes, win or lose. You repeatedly play that game until you lose. The probability of losing is <m>p</m> = 0.57.</p>
          <p>If we let <m>X</m> = the number of games you play until you lose (includes the losing game), then <m>X</m> is a geometric random variable. All three characteristics are met. Each game you play is a Bernoulli trial, either win or lose. You would need to play at least one game before you stop. <m>X</m> takes on the values 1, 2, 3, . . . (could go on indefinitely). Since we are measuring the number of games you play until you lose, we define a success as losing a game and a failure as winning a game. The probability of a success <m>p=.57</m> and the probability of a failure <m>q</m> = 1 – <m>p</m> = 1 – 0.57 = 0.43. Both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> remain the same from game to game.</p>
          <p>If we want to find the probability that it takes five games until you lose, then the probability could be written as <m>P</m>(<m>x</m> = 5). We will explain how to find a geometric probability later in this section.</p>

      </exercise>
      <example xml:id="element-15">
        <statement>
          <p>A safety engineer feels that 35 percent of all industrial accidents in her plant are caused by failure of employees to follow instructions. She decides to look at the accident reports (selected randomly and replaced in the pile after reading) <em>until</em> she finds one that shows an accident caused by failure of employees to follow instructions.</p>
          <p>If we let <m>X</m> = the number of accidents the safety engineer must examine until she finds a report showing an accident caused by employee failure to follow instructions, then <m>X</m> is a geometric random variable. All three characteristics are met. Each accident report she reads is a Bernoulli trial: the accident was either caused by failure of employees to follow instructions or not. She would need to read at least one accident report before she stops. <m>X</m> takes on the values 1, 2, 3, . . . (could go on indefinitely). Since we are measuring the number of reports she needs to read until one that shows an accident caused by failure of employees to follow instructions, we define a success as an accident caused by failure of employees to follow instructions. If an accident was caused by another reason, the report is defined as a failure. The probability of a success <m>p</m> = .35 and the probability of a failure <m>q=1-p=1-.35=.65</m>. Both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> remain the same from report to report.</p>
          <p>If we want to find the probability that the safety engineer will have to examine at least three reports until she finds a report showing an accident caused by employee failure to follow instructions, then the probability could be written as <m>p=.35</m>. If we want to find how many reports, on average, the safety engineer would <em>expect</em> to look at until she finds a report showing an accident caused by employee failure to follow instructions, we need to find the expected value <m>E</m>(<m>x</m>). We will explain how to solve these questions later in this section.</p>

      <p>There are five characteristics of a hypergeometric experiment:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You take samples from <em>two</em> groups.</li>
        <li>You are concerned with a group of interest, called the first group.</li>
        <li>You sample <em>without replacement</em> from the combined groups. For example, you want to choose a softball team from a combined group of 11 men and 13 women. The team consists of 10 players.</li>
        <li>Each pick is <em>not</em> independent, since sampling is without replacement. In the softball example, the probability of picking a woman first is <m>\frac{13}{24}</m>. The probability of picking a man second is <m>\frac{11}{23}</m> if a woman was picked first. It is <m>\frac{10}{23}</m> if a man was picked first. The probability of the second pick depends on what happened in the first pick.</li>
        <li>You are not dealing with Bernoulli trials.</li>

      <p>The outcomes of a hypergeometric experiment fit a <term>hypergeometric probability</term> distribution. The random variable <m>X</m> = the number of items from the group of interest.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="fs-idm319097760">
      <p>There are two main characteristics of a Poisson experiment.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The <term>Poisson probability distribution</term> gives the probability of a number of events occurring in a <em>fixed interval</em> of time or space if these events happen with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event. For example, a book editor might be interested in the number of words spelled incorrectly in a particular book. It might be that, on the average, there are five words spelled incorrectly in 100 pages. The interval is the 100 pages.</li>
        <li>The Poisson distribution may be used to approximate the binomial if the probability of success is <em>small</em> (such as .01) and the number of trials is <em>large</em> (such as 1,000). You will verify the relationship in the homework exercises. <m>n</m> is the number of trials, and <m>p</m> is the probability of a <em>success</em>.</li>
      </ol>

        <p>Let <m>X</m> = the number of loaves of bread put on the shelf in five minutes. If the average number of loaves put on the shelf in 30 minutes (half-hour) is 12, then the average number of loaves put on the shelf in five minutes is <m>(\frac{5}{30})</m>(12) = 2 loaves of bread.</p>

        <p>The Poisson distribution can be used to approximate probabilities for a binomial distribution. This next example demonstrates the relationship between the Poisson and the binomial distributions. Let <m>n</m> represent the number of binomial trials and let <m>p</m> represent the probability of a success for each trial. If <m>n</m> is large enough and <m>p</m> is small enough then the Poisson approximates the binomial very well. In general, <m>n</m> is considered “large enough” if it is greater than or equal to 20. The probability <m>p</m> from the binomial distribution should be less than or equal to 0.05. When the Poisson is used to approximate the binomial, we use the binomial mean <m>μ</m> = <m>np</m>. The variance of <m>X</m> is <m>σ</m>^{2} = <m>μ</m> and the standard deviation is <m>σ</m> = <m>\sqrt{\mu}</m>. The Poisson approximation to a binomial distribution was commonly used in the days before technology made both values very easy to calculate.</p>

        <p>On May 13, 2013, starting at 4:30 p.m., the probability of moderate seismic activity for the next 48 hours in the Kuril Islands off the coast of Japan was reported at about 1.43 percent.

      <p>A <term>Poisson probability distribution</term> of a discrete random variable gives the probability of a number of events occurring in a <em>fixed interval</em> of time or space, if these events happen at a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event. The Poisson distribution may be used to approximate the binomial, if the probability of success is <em>small</em> (less than or equal to .05) and the number of trials is <em>large</em> (greater than or equal to 20).</p>

      <p>a statistical experiment with the following properties: There are one or more Bernoulli trials with all failures except the last one, which is a success. In theory, the number of trials could go on forever; there must be at least one trial.

      <title>Poisson probability distribution</title>
      <p>a discrete random variable (RV) that counts the number of times a certain event will occur in a specific interval; characteristics of the variable: The probability that the event occurs in a given interval is the same for all intervals. The events occur with a known mean and independently of the time since the last event. The distribution is defined by the mean <m>\mu</m> of the event in the interval. Notation <m>X \sim P(\mu)</m>. The mean is <m>\mu = np</m>. The standard deviation is <m>\sigma = \sqrt{\mu}</m>. The probability of having exactly <m>x</m> successes in <m>r</m> trials is <m>P(X=x)= \frac{e^{-\mu} \mu^x}{x!}</m>. The Poisson distribution is often used to approximate the binomial distribution, when <m>n</m> is large and <m>p</m> is small (a general rule is that <m>n</m> should be greater than or equal to 20 and <m>p</m> should be less than or equal to 0.05).</p>
