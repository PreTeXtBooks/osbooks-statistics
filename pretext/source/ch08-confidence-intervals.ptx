      <title>Chapter Objectives</title>
      <p xml:id="element-281">By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</p>
      <ul xml:id="list12315">
        <li><p>Calculate and interpret confidence intervals for estimating a population mean and a population proportion</p></li>

    </objectives>

    <p xml:id="eip-123456789">Suppose you were trying to determine the mean rent of a two-bedroom apartment in your town. You might look in the classified section of the newspaper, write down several rents listed, and average them together. You would have obtained a point estimate of the true mean. If you are trying to determine the percentage of times you make a basket when shooting a basketball, you might count the number of shots you make and divide that by the number of shots you attempt. In this case, you would have obtained a point estimate for the true proportion.</p>

    <p xml:id="element-550">We use sample data to make generalizations about an unknown population. This part of statistics is called <term xml:id="term-00001">inferential statistics</term>. <em>The sample data help us to make an estimate of a population <term xml:id="term-00002">parameter</term></em>. We realize that the point estimate is most likely not the exact value of the population parameter, but close to it. After calculating point estimates, we construct interval estimates, called <em>confidence intervals</em>.</p>

    <p xml:id="element-667">In this chapter, you will learn to construct and interpret confidence intervals. You will also learn a new distribution, the Student's-<em>t</em>, and how it is used with those intervals. Throughout the chapter, it is important to keep in mind that the confidence interval is a random variable. It is the population parameter that is fixed.</p>

    <p xml:id="element-560">If you worked in the marketing department of an entertainment company, you might be interested in the mean number of songs a consumer downloads a month from an internet music store. If so, you could conduct a survey and calculate the sample mean, <m>\bar{x}</m>, and the sample standard deviation, <em>s</em>. You would use <m>\bar{x}</m> to estimate the population mean and <em>s</em> to estimate the population standard deviation. The sample mean, <m>\bar{x}</m>, is the <term xml:id="term-00003">point estimate</term> for the population mean, <em>μ</em>. The sample standard deviation, <em>s</em>, is the point estimate for the population standard deviation, <em>σ</em>.</p>

    <p xml:id="eip-65">Each instance of <m>\bar{x}</m> and <em>s</em> is called a <em>statistic</em>.</p>

    <p xml:id="element-510">A <term xml:id="term-00004">confidence interval</term> is another type of estimate but, instead of being just one number, it is an interval of numbers. The interval of numbers is a range of values calculated from a given set of sample data. The confidence interval is likely to include an unknown population parameter.</p>

    <p xml:id="element-53">Suppose, for the internet music example, we do not know the population mean, <em>μ</em>, but we do know that the population standard deviation is <em>σ</em> = 1 and our sample size is 100. Then, by the central limit theorem, the standard deviation for the sample mean is</p>

    <me xml:id="fs-id1164562170064">
      \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.1.
    </me>

    <p xml:id="element-730">The <term xml:id="term-00005">Empirical Rule</term>, which applies to bell-shaped distributions, says that in approximately 95 percent of the samples, the sample mean, <m>\bar{x}</m>, will be within two standard deviations of the population mean, <em>μ</em>. For our internet music example, two standard deviations would be calculated as (2)(0.1) = 0.2. The sample mean, <m>\bar{x}</m>, is likely to be within 0.2 units of <em>μ</em>.</p>

    <p xml:id="fs-id1164560823716">In this example, we do not know the true population mean <em>μ</em> (because we do not have information from all the internet music users!), but we can compute the sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> based on our sample of 100 individuals. Because the sample mean is likely to be within 0.2 units of the true population mean 95 percent of the times that we take a sample of 100 users, we can say with 95 percent confidence that <em>μ</em> is within 0.2 units of <m>\bar{x}</m>. In other words, <em>μ</em> is somewhere between <m>\bar{x} - 0.2</m> and <m>\bar{x} + 0.2</m>.</p>

    <p xml:id="fs-id1164563452758">Suppose that from the sample of 100 internet music customers, we compute a sample mean download of <m>\bar{x} = 2</m> songs per month. Since we know that the population standard deviation is <m>\sigma = 1</m>, according to the central limit theorem, the standard deviation for the sample means is <m>\sigma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.1</m>.</p>

    <p xml:id="fs-id1164564841116">We know that there is a 95 percent chance that the true population mean value <em>μ</em> is between two standard deviations from the sample mean. That is, with 95 percent confidence we can say that <em>μ</em> is between <m>\bar{x} + 2 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m> and <m>\bar{x} - 2 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m>.</p>

    <p xml:id="fs-id1164566885665">Replacing the symbols for their values in this example, we say that we are <em>95 percent confident</em> that the true average number of songs downloaded from an internet music store per month is between <me xml:id="fs-id1164562059797">\bar{x} - 2 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 2 - 2 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{100}} = 2 - 0.2 = 1.8, \text{ and}</me></p>

    <me xml:id="eip-123">
      \bar{x} + 2 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 2 + 2 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{100}} = 2 + 0.2 = 2.2.
    </me>

    <p xml:id="fs-id1164564919894"><em>The 95 percent confidence interval for</em> <em>μ</em> <em>is (1.8, 2.2)</em>.</p>

    <p xml:id="element-484">The 95 percent confidence interval implies two possibilities. Either the interval (1.8, 2.2) contains the true mean, <em>μ</em>, or our sample produced an <m>\bar{x}</m> that is not within 0.2 units of the true mean <em>μ</em>. The second possibility happens for only 5 percent of all the samples (95–100 percent).</p>

    <p xml:id="element-39">Remember that a confidence interval is created for an unknown population parameter like the population mean, <em>μ</em>. Confidence intervals for some parameters have the form</p>

    <p xml:id="element-75"><em>(point estimate – margin of error, point estimate + </em> <term xml:id="term-00006">margin of error</term><em>)</em>.</p>

    <p xml:id="element-485">The margin of error depends on the confidence level or percentage of confidence and the standard error of the mean.</p>

    <p xml:id="eip-255">When you read newspapers and journals, you might notice that some reports use the phrase <em>margin of error</em>. Other reports will not use that phrase, but include a confidence interval as the point estimate plus or minus the margin of error. Those are two ways of expressing the same concept.</p>

    <title>A Single Population Mean using the Normal Distribution</title>
    
    <p xml:id="eip-351">A confidence interval for a population mean with a known standard deviation is based on the fact that the sample means follow an approximately normal distribution. Suppose that our sample has a mean of <m>\bar{x}= 10</m> and we have constructed the 90 percent confidence interval (5, 15), where the margin of error = 5.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="eip-548">
      <title>Calculating the Confidence Interval</title>

      <p xml:id="eip-id1171249700620">To construct a confidence interval for a single unknown population mean, <em>μ</em>, <em>where the population standard deviation is known</em>, we need <m>\bar{x}</m> as an estimate for <em>μ</em>, and we need the margin of error. The margin of error for the population mean is called the <term xml:id="term-00001">error bound for a population mean</term> (<em>EBM</em>). The sample mean, <m>\bar{x},</m> is the point estimate of the unknown population mean, <em>μ</em>.</p>

    <p xml:id="eip-660">The confidence interval (<em>CI</em>) estimate will have the form:</p>

    <p xml:id="fs-idm11177728">(point estimate – error bound, point estimate + error bound) or, in symbols, (<m>\bar{x}–EBM,\bar{x}+EBM</m>).</p>

    <p xml:id="eip-id1171253180187">The margin of error (<em>EBM</em>) depends on the <term xml:id="term-00002">confidence level</term> (<em>CL</em>). The confidence level is often considered the probability that the calculated confidence interval estimate will contain the true population parameter. However, it is more accurate to state that the confidence level is the percentage of confidence intervals that contain the true population parameter when repeated samples are taken. Most often, the person constructing the confidence interval will choose a confidence level of 90 percent or higher, because that person wants to be reasonably certain of his or her conclusions.</p>

    <p xml:id="fs-id1164565293557">Another probability, which is called alpha <m>(α)</m> is related to the confidence level, <em>CL</em>. Alpha is the probability that the confidence interval does not contain the unknown population parameter. Mathematically, alpha can be computed as <m>α=1−CL</m>.</p>

    <example xml:id="eip-id1171253594561">
      <ul xml:id="eip-37">
        <li>
          <p>Suppose we have collected data from a sample. We know the sample mean, but we do not know the mean for the entire population.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The sample mean is seven, and the error bound for the mean is 2.5.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <me>\bar{x}\text{and}EBM= 2.5.</me>
      <p xml:id="eip-id1171253247744">The confidence interval is (7 – 2.5, 7 + 2.5), and calculating the values gives (4.5, 9.5).</p>
      <p xml:id="eip-id1171248980360">If the confidence level is 95 percent, then we say, "We estimate with 95 percent confidence that the true value of the population mean is between 4.5 and 9.5."</p>

    <p xml:id="eip-id1171249132425">To get a 90 percent confidence interval, we must include the central 90 percent of the probability of the normal distribution.

    <p xml:id="fs-id1164568060052">The critical value <em>1.645</em> is the <em>z-score</em> in a standard normal probability distribution that puts an area of <em>0.90</em> in the center, an area of <em>0.05</em> in the far left tail, and an area of <em>0.05</em> in the far right tail. To capture the central 90 percent, we must go out <em>1.645 standard deviations</em> on either side of the calculated sample mean.

    <p xml:id="eip-id1171249345209">It is important that the <em>standard deviation</em> used be appropriate for the parameter we are estimating, so in this section, we need to use the standard deviation that applies to sample means, which is <m>\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}}</m>. The fraction <m>\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}}</m> is commonly called the <em>standard error of the mean</em> in order to distinguish clearly the standard deviation for a mean from the population standard deviation, <em>σ</em>.</p>

      <title>Finding the <em>z</em>-Score for the Stated Confidence Level</title>

      <p xml:id="fs-idp7628608">When we know the population standard deviation, <em>σ</em>, we use a standard normal distribution to calculate the error bound <em>EBM</em> and construct the confidence interval. We need to find the value of <em>z</em> that puts an area equal to the confidence level (in decimal form) in the middle of the standard normal distribution <em>Z</em> ~ <em>N</em>(0, 1).</p>

      <p xml:id="eip-id1171249080440">The confidence level, <em>CL</em>, is the area in the middle of the standard normal distribution. <em>CL</em> = 1 – <em>α</em>, so <em>α</em> is the area that is split equally between the two tails.

      <title>Working Backward to Find the Error Bound or Sample Mean</title>

      <p xml:id="eip-719">When we calculate a confidence interval, we find the sample mean, calculate the error bound, and use them to calculate the confidence interval. However, sometimes when we read statistical studies, the study may state the confidence interval only.

      <li>
        <p>Or, from the upper value for the interval, subtract the lower value. Then divide the difference by 2.</p>

      <title>Chapter Review</title>

      <p xml:id="eip-120">In this module, we learned how to calculate the confidence interval for a single population mean where the population standard deviation is known. When estimating a population mean, the margin of error is called the error bound for a population mean (<em>EBM</em>). A confidence interval has the general form</p>

    <p xml:id="fs-idm46112">(lower bound, upper bound) = (point estimate – <em>EBM</em>, point estimate + <em>EBM</em>).</p>

    <p xml:id="eip-430">The calculation of <em>EBM</em> depends on the size of the sample and the level of confidence desired. The confidence level is the percentage of all possible samples that can be expected to include the true population parameter. As the confidence level increases, the corresponding <em>EBM</em> increases as well. As the sample size increases, the <em>EBM</em> decreases. By the central limit theorem,</p>

    <p xml:id="fs-idm70707712"><m>EBM=z\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}.}</m></p>

    <p xml:id="eip-974">Given a confidence interval, you can work backward to find the error bound (<em>EBM</em>) or the sample mean. To find the error bound, find the difference of the upper bound of the interval and the mean. If you do not know the sample mean, you can find the error bound by calculating half of the difference of the upper and lower bounds. To find the sample mean given a confidence interval, find the difference of the upper bound and the error bound. If the error bound is unknown, then average the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval to find the sample mean.</p>

    <p xml:id="eip-211">Sometimes researchers know in advance that they want to estimate a population mean within a specific margin of error for a given level of confidence. In that case, solve the <em>EBM</em> formula for <em>n</em> to discover the size of the sample that is needed to achieve this goal:</p>

    <me>n= \frac{z^{2}σ^{2}}{EBM^{2}}</me>

      <title>confidence interval (CI)</title>
      <p>an interval estimate for an unknown population parameter. This depends on the following:</p>
      <ul xml:id="confint1">
        <li><p>the desired confidence level,</p></li>
        <li><p>information that is known about the distribution (for example, known standard deviation), and</p></li>
