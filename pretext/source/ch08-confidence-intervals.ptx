      <title>Chapter Objectives</title>
      <p>By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Calculate and interpret confidence intervals for estimating a population mean and a population proportion</p></li>
        <li><p>Interpret the Student's <em>t</em> probability distribution as the sample size changes</p></li>
        <li><p>Discriminate between problems applying the normal and the Student's <em>t</em>-distributions</p></li>
        <li><p>Calculate the sample size required to estimate a population mean and a population proportion, given a desired confidence level and margin of error</p></li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>

    <p>Suppose you were trying to determine the mean rent of a two-bedroom apartment in your town. You might look in the classified section of the newspaper, write down several rents listed, and average them together. You would have obtained a point estimate of the true mean. If you are trying to determine the percentage of times you make a basket when shooting a basketball, you might count the number of shots you make and divide that by the number of shots you attempt. In this case, you would have obtained a point estimate for the true proportion.</p>

    <p>We use sample data to make generalizations about an unknown population. This part of statistics is called <term>inferential statistics</term>. <em>The sample data help us to make an estimate of a population <term>parameter</term></em>. We realize that the point estimate is most likely not the exact value of the population parameter, but close to it. After calculating point estimates, we construct interval estimates, called <em>confidence intervals</em>.</p>

    <p>In this chapter, you will learn to construct and interpret confidence intervals. You will also learn a new distribution, the Student's-<em>t</em>, and how it is used with those intervals. Throughout the chapter, it is important to keep in mind that the confidence interval is a random variable. It is the population parameter that is fixed.</p>

    <p>If you worked in the marketing department of an entertainment company, you might be interested in the mean number of songs a consumer downloads a month from an internet music store. If so, you could conduct a survey and calculate the sample mean, <m>\bar{x}</m>, and the sample standard deviation, <em>s</em>. You would use <m>\bar{x}</m> to estimate the population mean and <em>s</em> to estimate the population standard deviation. The sample mean, <m>\bar{x}</m>, is the <term>point estimate</term> for the population mean, <em>μ</em>. The sample standard deviation, <em>s</em>, is the point estimate for the population standard deviation, <em>σ</em>.</p>

    <p>Each instance of <m>\bar{x}</m> and <em>s</em> is called a <em>statistic</em>.</p>

    <p>A <term>confidence interval</term> is another type of estimate but, instead of being just one number, it is an interval of numbers. The interval of numbers is a range of values calculated from a given set of sample data. The confidence interval is likely to include an unknown population parameter.</p>

    <p>Suppose, for the internet music example, we do not know the population mean, <em>μ</em>, but we do know that the population standard deviation is <em>σ</em> = 1 and our sample size is 100. Then, by the central limit theorem, the standard deviation for the sample mean is</p>

    <me>
      \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.1.
    </me>

    <p>The <term>Empirical Rule</term>, which applies to bell-shaped distributions, says that in approximately 95 percent of the samples, the sample mean, <m>\bar{x}</m>, will be within two standard deviations of the population mean, <em>μ</em>. For our internet music example, two standard deviations would be calculated as (2)(0.1) = 0.2. The sample mean, <m>\bar{x}</m>, is likely to be within 0.2 units of <em>μ</em>.</p>

    <p>In this example, we do not know the true population mean <em>μ</em> (because we do not have information from all the internet music users!), but we can compute the sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> based on our sample of 100 individuals. Because the sample mean is likely to be within 0.2 units of the true population mean 95 percent of the times that we take a sample of 100 users, we can say with 95 percent confidence that <em>μ</em> is within 0.2 units of <m>\bar{x}</m>. In other words, <em>μ</em> is somewhere between <m>\bar{x} - 0.2</m> and <m>\bar{x} + 0.2</m>.</p>

    <p>Suppose that from the sample of 100 internet music customers, we compute a sample mean download of <m>\bar{x} = 2</m> songs per month. Since we know that the population standard deviation is <m>\sigma = 1</m>, according to the central limit theorem, the standard deviation for the sample means is <m>\sigma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.1</m>.</p>

    <p>We know that there is a 95 percent chance that the true population mean value <em>μ</em> is between two standard deviations from the sample mean. That is, with 95 percent confidence we can say that <em>μ</em> is between <m>\bar{x} + 2 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m> and <m>\bar{x} - 2 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m>.</p>

    <p>Replacing the symbols for their values in this example, we say that we are <em>95 percent confident</em> that the true average number of songs downloaded from an internet music store per month is between <me>\bar{x} - 2 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 2 - 2 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{100}} = 2 - 0.2 = 1.8, \text{ and}</me></p>

    <me>
      \bar{x} + 2 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 2 + 2 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{100}} = 2 + 0.2 = 2.2.
    </me>

    <p><em>The 95 percent confidence interval for</em> <em>μ</em> <em>is (1.8, 2.2)</em>.</p>

    <p>The 95 percent confidence interval implies two possibilities. Either the interval (1.8, 2.2) contains the true mean, <em>μ</em>, or our sample produced an <m>\bar{x}</m> that is not within 0.2 units of the true mean <em>μ</em>. The second possibility happens for only 5 percent of all the samples (95–100 percent).</p>

    <p>Remember that a confidence interval is created for an unknown population parameter like the population mean, <em>μ</em>. Confidence intervals for some parameters have the form</p>

    <p><em>(point estimate – margin of error, point estimate + </em> <term>margin of error</term><em>)</em>.</p>

    <p>The margin of error depends on the confidence level or percentage of confidence and the standard error of the mean.</p>

    <p>When you read newspapers and journals, you might notice that some reports use the phrase <em>margin of error</em>. Other reports will not use that phrase, but include a confidence interval as the point estimate plus or minus the margin of error. Those are two ways of expressing the same concept.</p>

    <title>A Single Population Mean using the Normal Distribution</title>
    
    <p>A confidence interval for a population mean with a known standard deviation is based on the fact that the sample means follow an approximately normal distribution. Suppose that our sample has a mean of <m>\bar{x}= 10</m> and we have constructed the 90 percent confidence interval (5, 15), where the margin of error = 5.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="ch8-eip-548">
      <title>Calculating the Confidence Interval</title>

      <p>To construct a confidence interval for a single unknown population mean, <em>μ</em>, <em>where the population standard deviation is known</em>, we need <m>\bar{x}</m> as an estimate for <em>μ</em>, and we need the margin of error. The margin of error for the population mean is called the <term>error bound for a population mean</term> (<em>EBM</em>). The sample mean, <m>\bar{x},</m> is the point estimate of the unknown population mean, <em>μ</em>.</p>

    <p>The confidence interval (<em>CI</em>) estimate will have the form:</p>

    <p>(point estimate – error bound, point estimate + error bound) or, in symbols, (<m>\bar{x}–EBM,\bar{x}+EBM</m>).</p>

    <p>The margin of error (<em>EBM</em>) depends on the <term>confidence level</term> (<em>CL</em>). The confidence level is often considered the probability that the calculated confidence interval estimate will contain the true population parameter. However, it is more accurate to state that the confidence level is the percentage of confidence intervals that contain the true population parameter when repeated samples are taken. Most often, the person constructing the confidence interval will choose a confidence level of 90 percent or higher, because that person wants to be reasonably certain of his or her conclusions.</p>

    <p>Another probability, which is called alpha <m>(α)</m> is related to the confidence level, <em>CL</em>. Alpha is the probability that the confidence interval does not contain the unknown population parameter. Mathematically, alpha can be computed as <m>α=1−CL</m>.</p>

    <example xml:id="ch8-eip-id1171253594561">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Suppose we have collected data from a sample. We know the sample mean, but we do not know the mean for the entire population.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The sample mean is seven, and the error bound for the mean is 2.5.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <me>\bar{x}\text{and}EBM= 2.5.</me>
      <p>The confidence interval is (7 – 2.5, 7 + 2.5), and calculating the values gives (4.5, 9.5).</p>
      <p>If the confidence level is 95 percent, then we say, "We estimate with 95 percent confidence that the true value of the population mean is between 4.5 and 9.5."</p>
    </example>

      <title>Try It</title>
      <statement>
          <p>Suppose we have data from a sample. The sample mean is 15, and the error bound for the mean is 3.2.</p>
          <p>What is the confidence interval estimate for the population mean?</p>

      </exercise>

    <p>A confidence interval for a population mean with a known standard deviation is based on the fact that the sample means follow an approximately normal distribution. Suppose that our sample has a mean of <m>\bar{x}</m> = 10, and we have constructed the 90 percent confidence interval (5, 15) where <em>EBM</em> = 5.</p>

    <p>To get a 90 percent confidence interval, we must include the central 90 percent of the probability of the normal distribution. If we include the central 90 percent, we leave out a total of <em>α</em> = 10 percent in both tails, or 5 percent in each tail, of the normal distribution.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>The critical value <em>1.645</em> is the <em>z-score</em> in a standard normal probability distribution that puts an area of <em>0.90</em> in the center, an area of <em>0.05</em> in the far left tail, and an area of <em>0.05</em> in the far right tail. To capture the central 90 percent, we must go out <em>1.645 standard deviations</em> on either side of the calculated sample mean. The critical value will change depending on the confidence level of the interval.</p>

    <p>It is important that the <em>standard deviation</em> used be appropriate for the parameter we are estimating, so in this section, we need to use the standard deviation that applies to sample means, which is <m>\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}}</m>. The fraction <m>\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}}</m> is commonly called the <em>standard error of the mean</em> in order to distinguish clearly the standard deviation for a mean from the population standard deviation, <em>σ</em>.</p>

    <ul>
      <title>In summary, as a result of the central limit theorem, the following statements apply:</title>
      <li>
        <p><m>\bar{X}</m> is normally distributed, that is, <m>\bar{X}</m> ~ <em>N</em><m>(μ_{X},\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}})</m>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When the population standard deviation <em>σ</em> is known, we use a normal distribution to calculate the error bound.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <title>Calculating the Confidence Interval</title>

      <p>To construct a confidence interval estimate for an unknown population mean, we need data from a random sample. The steps to construct and interpret the confidence interval are as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> Calculate the sample mean, <m>\bar{x},</m> from the sample data. Remember, in this section, we already know the population standard deviation, <em>σ</em>.</p>

          <p>Find the <em>z</em>-score that corresponds to the confidence level.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Construct the confidence interval.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If we denote the critical <em>z</em>-score by <m>z_{\frac{a}{2}}</m>, and the sample size by <em>n</em>, then the formula for the confidence interval with confidence level <m>Cl=1−α</m>, is given by <m>(\bar{x}−z_{\frac{a}{2}}\times\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}},\bar{x}+z_{\frac{a}{2}}\times\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}}).</m></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Write a sentence that interprets the estimate in the context of the situation in the problem. (Explain what the confidence interval means, in the words of the problem.)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We will first examine each step in more detail and then illustrate the process with some examples.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="ch8-fs-idm60964192">
      <title>Finding the <em>z</em>-Score for the Stated Confidence Level</title>

      <p>When we know the population standard deviation, <em>σ</em>, we use a standard normal distribution to calculate the error bound <em>EBM</em> and construct the confidence interval. We need to find the value of <em>z</em> that puts an area equal to the confidence level (in decimal form) in the middle of the standard normal distribution <em>Z</em> ~ <em>N</em>(0, 1).</p>

      <p>The confidence level, <em>CL</em>, is the area in the middle of the standard normal distribution. <em>CL</em> = 1 – <em>α</em>, so <em>α</em> is the area that is split equally between the two tails. Each of the tails contains an area equal to <m>\frac{α}{2}</m>.</p>

      <p>The <em>z</em>-score that has an area to the right of <m>\frac{α}{2}</m> is denoted by <m>z_{\frac{α}{2}}</m>.</p>

      <p>For example, when <em>CL</em> = 0.95, <em>α</em> = 0.05, and <m>\frac{α}{2}</m> = 0.025, we write <m>z_{\frac{α}{2}}</m> = <m>z</m><sub>0.025</sub>.</p>

      <p>The area to the right of <em>z</em><sub>0.025</sub> is 0.025 and the area to the left of <em>z</em><sub>0.025</sub> is 1 – 0.025 = 0.975.</p>

      <p><m>z_{\frac{α}{2}}=z_{0.025}= 1.96</m>, using a calculator, computer, or standard normal probability table.</p>

      <p>Normal table (see appendices) shows that the probability for 0 to 1.96 is 0.47500, and so the probability to the right tail of the critical value 1.96 is 0.5 – 0.475 = 0.025</p>

      <note xml:id="ch8-fs-idm6917168">
        <p><c>invNorm</c>(0.975, 0, 1) = 1.96. In this command, the value 0.975 is the total area to the left of the critical value that we are looking to calculate. The parameters 0 and 1 are the mean value and the standard deviation of the standard normal distribution Z.</p>

        <p>Remember to use the area to the LEFT of <m>z_{\frac{α}{2}}</m>. In this chapter, the last two inputs in the invNorm command are 0, 1, because you are using a standard normal distribution Z with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.</p>

            <p>Solution ATo find the confidence interval, start by finding the point estimate: the sample mean,</p>

      <p>Notice the difference in the confidence intervals calculated in <xref ref="example3"></xref> and the following <xref ref="ch8-fs-idp77326048">Try It</xref> exercise. These intervals are different for several reasons: they are calculated from different samples, the samples are different sizes, and the intervals are calculated for different levels of confidence. Even though the intervals are different, they do not yield conflicting information. The effects of these kinds of changes are the subject of the next section in this chapter.</p>

            <p>Explanation of 95 percent Confidence Level95 percent of all confidence intervals constructed in this way contain the true value of the population mean statistics exam score.</p>
            <p>Comparing the ResultsThe 90 percent confidence interval is (67.18, 68.82). The 95 percent confidence interval is (67.02, 68.98). The 95 percent confidence interval is wider. If you look at the graphs, because the area 0.95 is larger than the area 0.90, it makes sense that the 95 percent confidence interval is wider. For more certainty that the confidence interval actually does contain the true value of the population mean for all statistics exam scores, the confidence interval necessarily needs to be wider.</p>

      <title>Working Backward to Find the Error Bound or Sample Mean</title>

      <p>When we calculate a confidence interval, we find the sample mean, calculate the error bound, and use them to calculate the confidence interval. However, sometimes when we read statistical studies, the study may state the confidence interval only. If we know the confidence interval, we can work backward to find both the error bound and the sample mean.</p>

    <ul>
      <title>Finding the Error Bound</title>
      <li>
        <p>From the upper value for the interval, subtract the sample mean,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Or, from the upper value for the interval, subtract the lower value. Then divide the difference by 2.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <title>Finding the Sample Mean</title>
      <li>
        <p>Subtract the error bound from the upper value of the confidence interval,</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Or, average the upper and lower endpoints of the confidence interval.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Notice that there are two methods to perform each calculation. You can choose the method that is easier to use with the information you know.</p>

    <example xml:id="ch8-eip-209">
      <p>Suppose we know that a confidence interval is (67.18, 68.82) and we want to find the error bound. We may know that the sample mean is 68, or perhaps our source only gives the confidence interval and does not tell us the value of the sample mean.</p>
      <ul>
        <title>Calculate the error bound:</title>
        <li>
          <p>If we know that the sample mean is 68, <em>EBM</em> = 68.82 – 68 = 0.82.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If we do not know the sample mean, <em>EBM</em> = <m>\frac{(68.82−67.18)}{2}</m> = 0.82. The margin of error is the quantity that we add and subtract from the sample mean to obtain the confidence interval. Therefore, the margin of error is half of the length of the interval.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <title>Calculate the sample mean:</title>
        <li>
          <p>If we know the error bound,
    <m>\bar{x}</m> = 68.82 – 0.82 = 68.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If we do not know the error bound, <m>\bar{x}</m> = <m>\frac{(67.18+68.82)}{2}</m> = 68.</p>

      <title>Calculating the Sample Size <em>n</em></title>

      <p>If researchers desire a specific margin of error, then they can use the error bound formula to calculate the required sample size. In this situation, we are given the desired margin of error, <em>EBM</em>, and we need to compute the sample size <em>n</em>.</p>

    <p>The formula for sample size is <em>n</em> = <m>\frac{z^{2}σ^{2}}{EBM^{2}}</m>, found by solving the error bound formula for <em>n</em>. Always round up the value of <em>n</em> to the closest integer.</p>

    <p>In this formula, <em>z</em> is the critical value <m>z_{\frac{α}{2}}</m>, corresponding to the desired confidence level. A researcher planning a study who wants a specified confidence level and error bound can use this formula to calculate the size of the sample needed for the study.</p>

    <example xml:id="ch8-eip-324">
      <p>The population standard deviation for the age of Foothill College students is 15 years. If we want to be 95 percent confident that the sample mean age is within two years of the true population mean age of Foothill College students, how many randomly selected Foothill College students must be surveyed?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>From the problem, we know that <em>σ</em> = 15 and <em>EBM</em> = 2.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><em>z</em> = <em>z</em><sub>0.025</sub> = 1.96, because the confidence level is 95 percent.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><em>n</em> = <m>\frac{z^{2}σ^{2}}{EBM^{2}}</m> = <m>\frac{(1.96)^{2}(15)^{2}}{2^{2}}</m> = 216.09 using the sample size equation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Use <em>n</em> = 217. Always round the answer up to the next higher integer to ensure that the sample size is large enough.</p>
        </li>

      <p>Therefore, 217 Foothill College students should be surveyed in order to be 95 percent confident that we are within two years of the true population mean age of Foothill College students.</p>

      <title>Chapter Review</title>

      <p>In this module, we learned how to calculate the confidence interval for a single population mean where the population standard deviation is known. When estimating a population mean, the margin of error is called the error bound for a population mean (<em>EBM</em>). A confidence interval has the general form</p>

    <p>(lower bound, upper bound) = (point estimate – <em>EBM</em>, point estimate + <em>EBM</em>).</p>

    <p>The calculation of <em>EBM</em> depends on the size of the sample and the level of confidence desired. The confidence level is the percentage of all possible samples that can be expected to include the true population parameter. As the confidence level increases, the corresponding <em>EBM</em> increases as well. As the sample size increases, the <em>EBM</em> decreases. By the central limit theorem,</p>

    <p><m>EBM=z\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}.}</m></p>

    <p>Given a confidence interval, you can work backward to find the error bound (<em>EBM</em>) or the sample mean. To find the error bound, find the difference of the upper bound of the interval and the mean. If you do not know the sample mean, you can find the error bound by calculating half of the difference of the upper and lower bounds. To find the sample mean given a confidence interval, find the difference of the upper bound and the error bound. If the error bound is unknown, then average the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval to find the sample mean.</p>

    <p>Sometimes researchers know in advance that they want to estimate a population mean within a specific margin of error for a given level of confidence. In that case, solve the <em>EBM</em> formula for <em>n</em> to discover the size of the sample that is needed to achieve this goal:</p>

    <me>n= \frac{z^{2}σ^{2}}{EBM^{2}}</me>

      <p><m>\bar{X}~N(μ_{X},\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}})</m> The distribution of sample means is normally distributed with mean equal to the population mean and standard deviation given by the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.</p>

    <p>The general form for a confidence interval for a single population mean, known standard deviation, normal distribution is given by (lower bound, upper bound) = (point estimate – <em>EBM</em>, point estimate + <em>EBM</em>)</p>

    <me>=(\bar{x}−EBM,\bar{x}+EBM)</me>

    <me>=(\bar{x}−z\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}},\bar{x}+z\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}}).</me>

    <p><em>EBM</em> = <m>z\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}}</m> = the error bound for the mean, or the margin of error for a single population mean; this formula is used when the population standard deviation is known.</p>

    <p><em>CL</em> = confidence level, or the proportion of confidence intervals created that is expected to contain the true population parameter</p>

    <p><em>α</em> = 1 – <em>CL</em> = the proportion of confidence intervals that will not contain the population parameter</p>

    <p><m>z_{\frac{α}{2}}</m> = the <em>z</em>-score with the property that the area to the right of the <em>z</em>-score is <m>\frac{∝}{2}</m>; this is the <em>z</em>-score, used in the calculation of <em>EBM</em>, where α = 1 – <em>CL</em>.</p>

    <p><em>n</em> = <m>\frac{z^{2}σ^{2}}{EBM^{2}}</m> = the formula used to determine the sample size (<em>n</em>) needed to achieve a desired margin of error at a given level of confidence</p>

    <p>General form of a confidence interval</p>

    <p>(lower value, upper value) = (point estimate error bound, point estimate + error bound)</p>

    <p>To find the error bound when you know the confidence interval,</p>

    <p>error bound = upper value point estimate <alert>or</alert> error bound = <m>\frac{\text{upper value}−\text{lower value}}{2}.</m></p>

    <p>Single population mean, known standard deviation, normal distribution</p>

    <p>Use the normal distribution for means; population standard deviation is known: <em>EBM</em> = <em>z</em><m>\frac{α}{2}⋅\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}}</m></p>

    <p>The confidence interval has the format (<m>\bar{x}</m> − <em>EBM</em>, <m>\bar{x}</m> + <em>EBM</em>).</p>

  <title>A Single Population Mean using the Student t Distribution</title>

  <p>In practice, we rarely know the <alert>population</alert> <term>standard deviation</term>. In the past, when the sample size was large, this unknown number did not present a problem to statisticians. They used the sample standard deviation <em>s</em> as an estimate for <em>σ</em> and proceeded as before to calculate a <term>confidence interval</term> with close-enough results. However, statisticians ran into problems when the sample size was small. A small sample size caused inaccuracies in the confidence interval. </p>
  <p>William S. Gosset (1876–1937) of the Guinness brewery in Dublin, Ireland, ran into this  problem. His experiments with hops and barley produced very few samples. Just replacing <em>σ</em> with <em>s</em> did not produce accurate results when he tried to calculate a confidence interval. He realized that he could not use a normal distribution for the calculation; he found that the actual distribution depends on the sample size. This problem led him to <em>discover</em> what is called the <term>Student's <em>t</em>-distribution</term>. The name comes from the fact that Gosset wrote under the pen name <em>Student</em>.</p>
  <p>Up until the mid-1970s, some statisticians used the <term>normal distribution</term> approximation for large sample sizes and used the Student's <em>t</em>-distribution only for sample sizes of at most 30. With graphing calculators and computers, the practice now is to use the Student's <em>t</em>-distribution whenever <em>s</em> is used as an estimate for <em>σ</em>.</p>
  <p>If you draw a simple random sample of size <em>n</em> from a population that has an approximately normal distribution with mean <em>μ</em> and unknown population standard deviation <em>σ</em> and calculate the <em>t</em>-score <em>t</em> = <m>\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}})}</m>, then the <em>t</em>-scores follow a <em>Student's <em>t</em>-distribution with <em>n</em> – 1 degrees of freedom</em>. The <em>t</em>-score has the same interpretation as the <term><em>z</em>-score</term>: It measures how far <m>\bar{x}</m> is from its mean <em>μ</em>. For each sample size <em>n</em>, there is a different Student's <em>t</em>-distribution.</p>
  <p>The <em>degrees of freedom (<em>df</em>)</em>, <em>n</em> - 1, are the sample size minus 1.</p>
  <p><term>Properties of the Student's <em>t</em>-distribution</term></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The graph for the Student's <em>t</em>-distribution is similar to the standard normal curve.</li>
    <li>The mean for the Student's <em>t</em>-distribution is zero, and the distribution is symmetric about zero.</li>
    <li>The Student's <em>t</em>-distribution has more probability in its tails than the standard normal distribution. <xref ref="ch8-fs-id1164567593546"/> shows the graphs of the student <em>t</em>-distribution for 1, 2 and 5 degrees of freedom: (<em>v</em>), compare to the standard normal distribution (in black).
      <figure xml:id="ch8-fs-id1164567593546">

          <description>A graph showing a bell shaped curve of normal distribution with two vertical lines to the left and right of center. The vertical line to the left is labeled 6244 and the vertical line to the right is labeled 11014. The area between the vertical lines is shaded purple. The horizontal axis is unlabeled. There are three tick marks on the horizontal axis at the bottom of the vertical lines and at a point equidistant between the lines. The tick mark in the center of the bell curve is labeled 8629.</description>
        </image>
      </figure>





</li>
    <li>The exact shape of the Student's <em>t</em>-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom. As the degrees of freedom increase, the graph of the Student's <em>t</em>-distribution becomes more like the graph of the standard normal distribution.</li>
    <li>The underlying population of individual observations is assumed to be normally distributed with unknown population mean <em>μ</em> and unknown population standard deviation <em>σ</em>. The size of the underlying population is generally not relevant unless it is very small. If it is bell-shaped (normal), then the assumption is met and does not need discussion. Random sampling is assumed, but that is a completely separate assumption from normality.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="finger">Calculators and computers can easily calculate any Student's <em>t</em>-probabilities. The TI-83, 83+, and 84+ have a tcdf function to find the probability for given values of <em>t</em>. The grammar for the tcdf command is tcdf(lower bound, upper bound, degrees of freedom). However, for confidence intervals, we need to use inverse probability to find the value of <em>t</em> when we know the probability.</p>
  <p>For the TI-84+, you can use the invT command on the DISTRibution menu. The invT command works similarly to the invnorm. The invT command requires two inputs: invT(area to the left, degrees of freedom). The output is the <em>t</em>-score that corresponds to the area we specified. 


 The TI-83 and 83+ do not have the invT command. (The TI-89 has an inverse T command.)</p>
  <p>A probability table for the Student's <em>t</em>-distribution can also be used. The table gives critical <em>t</em>-values that correspond to the confidence level (column) and degrees of freedom (row). (The TI-86 does not have an invT program or command, so if you are using that calculator, you need to use a probability table for the Student's <em>t</em>-distribution.) When using a <em>t</em>-table, note that some tables are formatted to show the confidence level in the column headings, while the column headings in some tables may show only corresponding area in one or both tails.


 
A Student's <em>t</em>-table (see ) gives <em>t</em>-scores given the degrees of freedom and the right-tailed probability. The table is very limited. <em>Calculators and computers can easily calculate any Student's  t-probabilities.</em>

    <p>In many cases, the researcher does not know the population standard deviation, <em>σ</em>, of the measure being studied. In these cases, it is common to use the sample standard deviation, <em>s</em>, as an estimate of <em>σ</em>. The normal distribution creates accurate confidence intervals when <em>σ</em> is known, but it is not as accurate when <em>s</em> is used as an estimate. In this case, the Student’s <em>t</em>-distribution is much better. Define a <em>t</em>-score using the following formula:</p>
    <me>t= \frac{\bar{x}- \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}</me>
    <p>The <em>t</em>-score follows the Student’s <em>t</em>-distribution with <em>n</em> – 1 degrees of freedom. The confidence interval under this distribution is calculated with <em>EBM</em> = <m>(t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}})\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}\text{,}}</m> where <m>t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}</m> is the <em>t</em>-score with area to the right equal to <m>\frac{\alpha}{2}</m>, <em>s</em> is the sample standard deviation, and <em>n</em> is the sample size. Use a table, calculator, or computer to find <m>t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}</m> for a given <em>α</em>.</p>

    <p><em>df</em> = <em>n</em> – 1; the degrees of freedom for a Student’s <em>t</em>-distribution, where <em>n</em> represents the size of the sample</p>

Often, election polls are calculated with 95 percent confidence, so the pollsters would be 95 percent confident that the true proportion of voters who favored the candidate would be between 0.37 and 0.43 (0.40 – 0.03, 0.40 + 0.03).</p>
    <p>Investors in the stock market are interested in the true proportion of stocks that go up and down each week. Businesses that sell personal computers are interested in the proportion of households in the United States that own personal computers. Confidence intervals can be calculated for the true proportion of stocks that go up or down each week and for the true proportion of households in the United States that own personal computers.</p>
    <p>The procedure to find the confidence interval, the sample size, the <term>error bound</term> <alert>for a population (<em>EBP</em>)</alert>, and the <term>confidence level</term> for a proportion is similar to that for the population mean, but the formulas are different.</p>
    <p>How do you know you are dealing with a proportion problem? First, the data that you are collecting is categorical, consisting of two categories: Success or Failure, Yes or No. Examples of situations where you are the following trying to estimate the true population proportion are the following: What proportion of the population smoke? What proportion of the population will vote for candidate A? What proportion of the population has a college-level education?</p>
    <p>The distribution of the sample proportions (based on samples of size <em>n</em>) is denoted by <em>P′</em> (read “P prime”).</p>
    <p>The central limit theorem for proportions asserts that the sample proportion distribution <em>P′</em> follows a normal distribution with mean value <em>p</em>, and standard deviation <m>\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}</m>, where <em>p</em> is the population proportion and <em>q</em> = 1 - <em>p</em>.</p>
    <p>The confidence interval has the form (<em>p′</em> – <em>EBP</em>, <em>p′</em> + <em>EBP</em>). <em>EBP</em> is error bound for the proportion.</p>
    <me>p'\text{ = }\frac{x}{n}</me>
    <p><em>p′</em> = the <em>estimated proportion</em> of successes (<em>p′</em> is a <em>point estimate</em> for <em>p</em>, the true proportion.)</p>
    <p><em>x</em> = the <em>number</em> of successes</p>
    <p><em>n</em> = the size of the sample</p>
    <p><em>The error bound for a proportion is</em></p>
    <p>
  <m>EBP=(z_{\frac{α}{2}})(\sqrt{\frac{p^{'}q^{'}}{n}})\text{,}</m> where <em>q′</em> = 1 – <em>p′</em>.</p>
    <p>This formula is similar to the error bound formula for a mean, except that the "appropriate standard deviation" is different. For a mean, when the population standard deviation is known, the appropriate standard deviation that we use is <m>\frac{σ}{\sqrt{n}}</m>. For a proportion, the appropriate standard deviation is <m>\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}</m>.</p>
    <p>However, in the error bound formula, we use
  <m>\sqrt{\frac{p^{'}q^{'}}{n}}</m> as the standard deviation, instead of <m>\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}</m>.</p>
    <p>In the error bound formula, the <em>sample proportions <em>p′</em> and <em>q′</em>, are estimates of the unknown population proportions <em>p</em> and <em>q</em></em>. The estimated proportions <em>p′</em> and <em>q′</em> are used because <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are not known. The sample proportions <em>p′</em> and <em>q′</em> are calculated from the data: <em>p′</em> is the estimated proportion of successes, and <em>q′</em> is the estimated proportion of failures.</p>
    <p>The confidence interval can be used only if the number of successes <em>np′</em> and the number of failures <em>nq′</em> are both greater than five.</p>
    <p>That is, in order to use the formula for confidence intervals for proportions, you need to verify that both <m>np^{'} \geq 5</m> and <m>nq^{'} \geq 5</m>.</p>

    <title><em>Plus-Four</em> Confidence Interval for <em>p</em></title>
    <p>There is a certain amount of error introduced into the process of calculating a confidence interval for a proportion. Because we do not know the true proportion for the population, we are forced to use point estimates to calculate the appropriate standard deviation of the sampling distribution. Studies have shown that the resulting estimation of the standard deviation can be flawed.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, there is a simple adjustment that allows us to produce more accurate confidence intervals: We simply pretend that we have four additional observations. Two of these observations are successes, and two are failures. The new sample size, then, is <em>n</em> + 4, and the new count of successes is <em>x</em> + 2. </p>
    <p>Computer studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the <alert>plus-four confidence interval for <em>p</em> method</alert>. It should be used when the confidence level desired is at least 90 percent and the sample size is at least ten.</p>

    <title>Chapter Review</title>
    <p>Some statistical measures, like many survey questions, measure qualitative rather than quantitative data. In this case, the population parameter being estimated is a proportion. It is possible to create a confidence interval for the true population proportion by following procedures similar to those used in creating confidence intervals for population means. The formulas are slightly different, but they follow the same reasoning.</p>
    <p>Let <em>p′</em> represent the sample proportion, <em>x/n</em>, where <em>x</em> represents the number of successes, and <em>n</em> represents the sample size. Let <em>q′</em> = 1 – <em>p′</em>. Then the confidence interval for a population proportion is given by the following formula:</p>
    <p>(lower bound, upper bound) <m>=(p^{'}-EBP,p^{'} +EBP)= (p^{'}-z\sqrt{\frac{p^{'}q^{'}}{n}},p^{'}+z\sqrt{\frac{p^{'}q^{'}}{n}})\text{.}</m>
</p>
    <p>The <alert>plus–four method</alert> for calculating confidence intervals is an attempt to balance the error introduced by using estimates of the population proportion when calculating the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. Simply imagine four additional trials in the study; two are successes and two are failures. Calculate <m>p^{'}=\frac{x+2}{n+4}</m>, and proceed to find the confidence interval. When sample sizes are small, this method has been demonstrated to provide more accurate confidence intervals than the standard formula used for larger samples.</p>

    <p><em>p′ = x/n</em>, where <em>x</em> represents the number of successes and <em>n</em> represents the sample size. The variable <em>p</em>′ is the sample proportion and serves as the point estimate for the true population proportion.</p>

    <p><m>p^{'} \sim N(p,\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}})</m> The variable <em>p′</em> has a <alert>binomial distribution</alert> that can be approximated with the normal distribution shown here,</p>
