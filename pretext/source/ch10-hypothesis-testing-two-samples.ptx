      <title>Chapter Objectives</title>
      <p>By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Classify hypothesis tests by type</li>

    <p>Studies often compare two groups. For example, researchers are interested in the effect aspirin has in preventing heart attacks. Over the last few years, newspapers and magazines have reported various aspirin studies involving two groups. Typically, one group is given aspirin and the other group is given a placebo. Then, the heart attack rate is studied over several years.</p>
    <p>There are other situations that deal with the comparison of two groups. For example, studies compare various diet and exercise programs. Politicians compare the proportion of individuals from different income brackets who might vote for them. Students are interested in whether the SAT or GRE preparatory courses really help raise their scores.</p>
    <p>You have learned to conduct hypothesis tests on single means and single proportions. You will expand upon that in this chapter. You will compare two means or two proportions to each other. The general procedure is the same, just expanded.</p>
    <p>To compare two means or two proportions, you work with two groups. The groups are classified as <em>independent groups</em> or <em>matched pairs</em>. <em>Independent groups</em> consist of two samples that are independent, that is, sample values selected from one population are not related in any way to sample values selected from the other population. <em>Matched pairs</em> consist of two samples that are dependent. The parameter tested using matched pairs is the population mean. The parameters tested using independent groups are either population means or population proportions.</p>

      <title>NOTE</title>
      <p>This chapter relies on either a calculator or a computer to calculate the degrees of freedom, the test statistics, and <m>p</m> values. TI-83+ and TI-84 instructions are included, as well as the test statistic formulas. When using a TI-83+ or TI-84 calculator, we do not need to separate two population means, independent groups, or population variances unknown into large and small sample sizes. However, most statistical computer software has the ability to differentiate these tests.</p>

      <title>NOTE</title>
      <p>The test comparing two independent population means with unknown and possibly unequal population standard deviations is called the Aspin-Welch <m>t</m>-test. The degrees of freedom formula was developed by Aspin-Welch.</p>
    </note>
    <p>The comparison of two population means is very common. A difference between the two samples depends on both the means and the standard deviations. Very different means can occur by chance if there is great variation among the individual samples. To account for the variation, we take the difference of the sample means,

<m>\overline{X}_{1}-\overline{X}_{2}</m>, and divide by the standard error to standardize the difference. The result is a <m>t</m>-score test statistic.</p>
    <p>Because we do not know the population standard deviations, we estimate them using the two sample standard deviations from our independent samples. For the hypothesis test, we calculate the estimated <term>standard deviation</term>, or <term>standard error</term>, of the difference in sample means,
<m>\overline{X}_{1}-\overline{X}_{2}\text{.}</m></p>
    <p>The standard error is calculated as follows:</p>
    <me>\sqrt{\frac{(s_{1})^{2}}{n_{1}}+\frac{(s_{2})^{2}}{n_{2}}}</me>
    <p>The test statistic (<m>t</m>-score) is calculated as follows:
  <m>\frac{\text{(}x¯_{1}-x¯_{2}\text{)}-\text{(}\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\text{)}}{\sqrt{\frac{\text{(}s_{1}\text{)}^{2}}{n_{1}}+\frac{\text{(}s_{2}\text{)}^{2}}{n_{2}}}}</m>

where <m>s_{1}</m> and <m>s_{2}</m>, the sample standard deviations, are estimates of <m>\sigma_{1}</m> and <m>\sigma_{2}</m>, respectively,
  <m>\sigma_{1}</m> and <m>\sigma_{2}</m> are the unknown population standard deviations,
<m>\bar{x}_{1}</m> and <m>\bar{x}_{2}</m> are the sample means, and 
<m>\mu_{1}</m> and <m>\mu_{2}</m> are the population means.</p>
    <p>The number of <term>degrees of freedom (<m>df</m>)</term> requires a somewhat complicated calculation. However, a computer or calculator calculates it easily. The <m>df</m> are not always a whole number. The test statistic calculated previously is approximated by the Student’s <m>t</m>-distribution with <m>df</m> as follows:</p>
    <p>Degrees of freedom</p>
    <me>df=\frac{(\frac{(s_{1})^{2}}{n_{1}}+\frac{(s_{2})^{2}}{n_{2}})^{2}}{(\frac{1}{n_{1}-1})(\frac{(s_{1})^{2}}{n_{1}})^{2}+(\frac{1}{n_{2}-1})(\frac{(s_{2})^{2}}{n_{2}})^{2}}</me>
    <p>When both sample sizes <m>n_{1}</m> and <m>n_{2}</m> are five or larger, the Student's <m>t</m> approximation is very good. Notice that the sample variances <m>(s_{1})^{2}</m> and <m>(s_{2})^{2}</m> are not pooled. (If the question comes up, do not pool the variances.)</p>

      <title>Independent groups</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Is there a difference in the mean amount of time boys and girls aged 7 to 11 play sports each day? Test at the 5 percent level of significance.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>The population standard deviations are not known. Let <m>g</m> be the subscript for girls and <m>b</m> be the subscript for boys. Then, <em>μ_{g}</em> is the population mean for girls and <em>μ_{b}</em> is the population mean for boys. This is a test of two independent groups, two population means.</p>
        <p><term>Random variable</term>:
  <m>\overline{X}_{g}-\overline{X}_{b}</m>
 = difference in the sample mean amount of time girls and boys play sports each day.

<nbsp/><m>H</m>_{0}: <em>μ_{g}</em> = <em>μ_{b}</em>  <em>H_{0}</em>: <em>μ_{g}</em> – <em>μ_{b}</em> = 0

<nbsp/><em>H_{a}</em>: <em>μ_{g}</em> ≠ <em>μ_{b}</em>  <em>H_{a}</em>: <em>μ_{g}</em> – <em>μ_{b}</em> ≠ 0
<nbsp/>The words <em>the same</em> tell you <em>H_{0}</em> has an "=". Since there are no other words to indicate <em>H_{a}</em>, assume it says <em>is different.</em>
This is a two-tailed test.</p>
        <p>Distribution for the test:
Use <em>t_{df}</em> where <m>df</m> is calculated using the <m>df</m> formula for independent groups, two population means. Using a calculator, <m>df</m> is approximately 18.8462. <em>Do not pool the variances.</em></p>
        <p>Calculate the <m>p</m>-value using a Student’s <m>t</m>-distribution: <m>p</m>-value = 0.0054</p>
        <p>Graph:</p>
        <p><nbsp/><m>s_{g}=0.866</m>
<nbsp/><m>s_{b}=1</m>

<nbsp/>So, <m>x¯_{g}-x¯_{b}</m> = 2 – 3.2 = –1.2
<nbsp/>Half the <m>p</m>-value is below –1.2, and half is above 1.2.</p>
        <p>Make a decision: Since <m>α</m> &gt; <m>p</m>-value, reject <em>H_{0}</em>. This means you reject <em>μ_{g}</em> = <em>μ_{b}</em>. The means are different.</p>

        <p>Conclusion: At the 5 percent level of significance, the sample data show there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean number of hours that girls and boys aged 7 to 11 play sports per day is different (mean number of hours  boys aged 7 to 11 play sports per day is greater than the mean number of hours played by girls OR the mean number of hours  girls aged 7 to 11 play sports per day is greater than the mean number of hours played by boys).</p>

    <p>Cohen’s Standards for Small, Medium, and Large Effect Sizes<term>Cohen’s <m>d</m></term> is a measure of effect size based on the differences between two means. Cohen’s <m>d</m>, named for U.S. statistician Jacob Cohen, measures the relative strength of the differences between the means of two populations based on sample data. The calculated value of effect size is then compared to Cohen’s standards of small, medium, and large effect sizes.</p>
    <p>Cohen’s <m>d</m> is the measure of the difference between two means divided by the pooled standard deviation: <m>d=\frac{x¯_{1}-x¯_{2}}{s_{pooled}}</m> where <m>s_{pooled}=\sqrt{\frac{(n_{1}-1)s12+(n_{2}-1)s22}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}}</m>.</p>

    <title>Two Population Means with Known Standard Deviations</title>

    <p>Even though this situation is not likely (knowing the population standard deviations), the following example illustrates hypothesis testing for independent means, known population standard deviations. The sampling distribution for the difference between the means is normal, and both populations must be normal. The random variable is


<m>X¯_{1}-X¯_{2}</m>. The normal distribution has the following format:
<nbsp/>Normal distribution is
<m>X¯_{1}-X¯_{2}\simN[\mu_{1}-\mu_{2},\sqrt{\frac{(\sigma_{1})^{2}}{n_{1}}+\frac{(\sigma_{2})^{2}}{n_{2}}}].</m></p>
    <me>\sqrt{\frac{(\sigma_{1})^{2}}{n_{1}}+\frac{(\sigma_{2})^{2}}{n_{2}}}\text{.}</me>
    <me>z=\frac{(x¯_{1}-x¯_{2})-(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})}{\sqrt{\frac{(\sigma_{1})^{2}}{n_{1}}+\frac{(\sigma_{2})^{2}}{n_{2}}}}\text{.}</me>

        <p>The words <em>is more effective</em> says that Wax 1 lasts longer than Wax 2, on average. <em>Longer</em> is a <em>&gt;</em> symbol and goes into <em>H_{a}</em>. Therefore, this is a right-tailed test.</p>

        <p><m>X¯_{1}-X¯_{2}\simN(0,\sqrt{\frac{0.33^{2}}{20}+\frac{0.36^{2}}{20}}).</m></p>
        <p>Since <em>μ_{1}</em> ≤ <em>μ_{2}</em>, then <em>μ_{1}</em> – <em>μ_{2}</em> ≤ 0 and the mean for the normal distribution is zero.</p>

    <title>Comparing Two Independent Population Proportions</title>

    <p>When conducting a hypothesis test that compares two independent population proportions, the following characteristics should be present:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The two independent samples are simple random samples that are independent.</li>
      <li>The number of successes is at least five, and the number of failures is at least five, for each of the samples.</li>
      <li>Growing literature states that the population must be at least 10 or 20 times the size of the sample. This keeps each population from being over-sampled and causing incorrect results.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Comparing two proportions, like comparing two means, is common. If two estimated proportions are different, it may be due to a difference in the populations or it may be due to chance. A hypothesis test can help determine if a difference in the estimated proportions reflects a difference in the population proportions.</p>
    <p>The difference of two proportions follows an approximate normal distribution. Generally, the null hypothesis states that the two proportions are the same. That is, <em>H_{0}</em>: <em>p_{A}</em> = <em>p_{B}</em>. To conduct the test, we use a <term>pooled proportion</term>, <em>p_{c}</em>.</p>
    <p>The pooled proportion is calculated as follows:</p>
    <me>p_{c}=\frac{x_{A}+x_{B}}{n_{A}+n_{B}}\text{.}</me>
    <p>The distribution for the differences is</p>
    <me>P′_{A}-P′_{B}\simN[0,\sqrt{p_{c}(1-p_{c})(\frac{1}{n_{A}}+\frac{1}{n_{B}})}].</me>
    <p>The test statistic (<m>z</m>-score) is</p>
    <me>z=\frac{(p′_{A}-p′_{B})-(p_{A}-p_{B})}{\sqrt{p_{c}(1-p_{c})(\frac{1}{n_{A}}+\frac{1}{n_{B}})}}.</me>

Twelve out of another random sample of 200 adults given Medication B still had hives 30 minutes after taking the medication. Test at a 1 percent level of significance.</p>

        <p>The problem asks for a difference in proportions, making it a test of two proportions.</p>
        <p>Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be the subscripts for Medication A and Medication B, respectively. Then, <em>p_{A}</em> and <em>p_{B}</em> are the desired population proportions.</p>

        <p><em>p_{A}</em> – <em>p_{B}</em> ≠ 0</p>
        <p>The words <em>is a difference</em> tell you the test is two-tailed.</p>
        <p>Distribution for the test: Since this is a test of two binomial population proportions, the distribution is normal:</p>
        <p><m>p_{c}=\frac{x_{A}+x_{B}}{n_{A}+n_{B}}=\frac{20+12}{200+200}=0.081-p_{c}=0.92</m></p>
        <p><m>P′_{A}-P′_{B}\simN[0,\sqrt{(0.08)(0.92)(\frac{1}{200}+\frac{1}{200})}]</m></p>

        <p>Calculate the <m>p</m>-value using the normal distribution: <m>p</m>-value = 0.1404.</p>
        <p>Estimated proportion for group A: <m>p′_{A}=\frac{x_{A}}{n_{A}}=\frac{20}{200}=0.1</m></p>

    <title>Matched or Paired Samples</title>

    <p>When using a hypothesis test for matched or paired samples, the following characteristics should be present:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Simple random sampling is used.</li>
      <li>Sample sizes are often small.</li>
      <li>Two measurements (samples) are drawn from the same pair of individuals or objects.</li>
      <li>Differences are calculated from the matched or paired samples.</li>
      <li>The differences form the sample that is used for the hypothesis test.</li>
      <li>Either the matched pairs have differences that come from a population that is normal or the number of differences is sufficiently large so that distribution of the sample mean of differences is approximately normal.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In a hypothesis test for matched or paired samples, subjects are matched in pairs and differences are calculated. The differences are the data. The population mean for the differences, <em>μ_{d}</em>, is then tested using a Student’s-<m>t</m> test for a single population mean with <m>n</m> – 1 degrees of freedom, where <m>n</m> is the number of differences.</p>
    <p>The test statistic (<m>t</m>-score) is</p>
    <me>t=\frac{x¯_{d}-\mu_{d}}{(\frac{s_{d}}{\sqrt{n}})}\text{.}</me>

        <p>A study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of pain-reducing medication. Results for randomly selected subjects are shown in . A lower score indicates less pain. The <em>before</em> value is matched to an <em>after</em> value, and the differences are calculated. The differences have a normal distribution. Are the sensory measurements, on average, lower after the medication? Test at a 5 percent significance level.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>Corresponding <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> values form matched pairs. (Calculate <em>after</em> – <em>before</em>.)</p>
        <p>The data for the test are the differences: {0.2, –4.1, –1.6, –1.8, –3.2, –2, –2.9, –9.6}</p>
        <p>The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the differences are: <m>x_{d}=–3.13</m> and <m>s_{d}=2.91</m>
<nbsp/>Verify these values.</p>
        <p>Let <m>\mu_{d}</m> be the population mean for the differences. We use the subscript <m>d</m> to denote <em>differences</em>.</p>
        <p>Random variable:
<m>X¯_{d}</m> = the mean difference of the sensory measurements.</p>
        <p><em>H_{0}</em>: <em>μ_{d}</em> ≥ 0</p>
        <p>The null hypothesis is zero or positive, meaning that there is the same or more pain felt after taking the medication. That means the subject shows no improvement. <em>μ_{d}</em> is the population mean of the differences.</p>
        <p><em>H_{a}</em>: <em>μ_{d}</em> &lt; 0</p>
        <p>The alternative hypothesis is negative, meaning there is less pain felt after taking the medication. That means the subject shows improvement. The score should be lower after taking the medication, so the difference ought to be negative to indicate improvement.</p>
        <p>Distribution for the test: The distribution is a Student’s <m>t</m> with <m>df</m> = <m>n</m> – 1 = 8 – 1 = 7. Use <m>t</m>_{7}. Note that the test is for a single population mean.</p>
        <p>Calculate the <m>p</m>-value using the Student’s-<m>t</m> distribution: <m>p</m>-value = 0.0095</p>

        <p><m>X¯_{d}</m> is the random variable for the differences.</p>
        <p>The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the differences are as follows:</p>
        <p><m>x¯_{d}</m> = –3.13</p>
        <p><m>s¯_{d}</m> = 2.91</p>
        <p>Compare <m>α</m> and the <m>p</m>-value: <m>α</m> = 0.05 and <m>p</m>-value = 0.0095. <m>α</m> &gt; <m>p</m>-value.</p>
        <p>Make a decision: Since <m>α</m> &gt; <m>p</m>-value, reject <em>H_{0}</em>. This means that <em>μ_{d}</em> &lt; 0 and there is improvement.</p>
        <p>Conclusion: At a 5 percent level of significance, from the sample data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the sensory measurements, on average, are lower after taking the medication. The medication appears to be effective in reducing pain.</p>

      <p>A college football coach was interested in whether the college’s strength development class increased his players’ maximum lift (in pounds) on the bench press exercise. He asked four of his players to participate in a study. The amount of weight they could each lift was recorded before they took the strength development class. After completing the class, the amount of weight they could each lift was again measured. The data are as follows:</p>
      <p>The coach wants to know if the strength development class makes his players stronger, on average.
<nbsp/>Record the <em>differences</em> data. Calculate the differences by subtracting the amount of weight lifted prior to the class from the weight lifted after completing the class. The data for the differences are: {90, 11, -8, -8}. Assume the differences have a normal distribution.</p>
