      <title>Chapter Objectives</title>
      <p>By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand and use the terminology of probability</li>
        <li>Determine whether two events are mutually exclusive and whether two events are independent</li>
        <li>Calculate probabilities using the addition rules and multiplication rules</li>
        <li>Construct and interpret contingency tables</li>
        <li>Construct and interpret Venn diagrams</li>
        <li>Construct and interpret tree diagrams</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>

    <p>It is often necessary to <em>guess</em> about the outcome of an event in order to make a decision. Politicians study polls to guess their likelihood of winning an election. Teachers choose a particular course of study based on what they think students can comprehend. Doctors choose the treatments needed for various diseases based on their assessment of likely results. You may have visited a casino where people play games chosen because of the belief that the likelihood of winning is good. You may have chosen your course of study based on the probable availability of jobs.</p>

    <p>You have, more than likely, used probability. In fact, you probably have an intuitive sense of probability. Probability deals with the chance of an event occurring. Whenever you weigh the odds of whether or not to do your homework or to study for an exam, you are using probability. In this chapter, you will learn how to solve probability problems using a systematic approach.</p>

      <p>How likely is it that a randomly chosen person in your class has change in his or her pocket? Would you say that it is very likely? Somewhat likely? Not likely?</p>
      
      <p>How likely is it that a randomly chosen person in your class has ridden a bus in the past month?</p>
      
      <p>If a person is chosen at random from your classroom and you know that he or she has ridden a bus in the past month, do you think that person is more likely or less likely to have change?</p>
      
      <p>Probability theory allows us to measure how likely or unlikely a given result is.</p>
      
      <p>Your instructor will survey your class. Count the number of students in the class today.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Raise your hand if you have any change in your pocket or purse. Record the number of raised hands.</li>
        <li>Raise your hand if you rode a bus within the past month. Record the number of raised hands.</li>
        <li>Raise your hand if you answered <em>yes</em> to BOTH of the first two questions. Record the number of raised hands.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Use the class data as estimates of the following probabilities. <em>P</em>(change) means the probability that a randomly chosen person in your class has change in his/her pocket or purse. <em>P</em>(bus) means the probability that a randomly chosen person in your class rode a bus within the last month and so on. Discuss your answers.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Find <em>P</em>(change).</li>
        <li>Find <em>P</em>(bus).</li>
        <li>Find <em>P</em>(change AND bus). Find the probability that a randomly chosen student in your class has change in his/her pocket or purse and rode a bus within the last month.</li>
        <li>Find <em>P</em>(change|bus). Find the probability that a randomly chosen student has change given that he or she rode a bus within the last month. Count all the students who rode a bus. From the group of students who rode a bus, count those who have change. The probability is equal to those who have change and rode a bus divided by those who rode a bus.</li>

    <title>Terminology</title>


    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164565663984">
      <p><term>Probability</term> is a measure that is associated with how certain we are of results, or outcomes, of a particular activity. When the activity is a planned operation carried out under controlled conditions, it is called an <alert>experiment</alert>. If the result is <em>not</em> predetermined, then the experiment is said to be a chance experiment. Each time the experiment is attempted is called a trial.</p>
      <p>Examples of chance experiments include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>flipping a fair coin,</li>
        <li>spinning a spinner,</li>
        <li>drawing a marble at random from a bag, and</li>
        <li>rolling a pair of dice.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A result of an experiment is called an <alert>outcome</alert>. The <alert>sample space</alert> of an experiment is the set, or collection, of all possible outcomes.</p>
      <p>There are four main ways to represent a sample space:</p>
      <table xml:id="fs-id1164565591567">
        <tabular>
          <row><cell></cell><cell>Flipping a Fair Coin</cell><cell>Flipping Two Fair Coins</cell></row>
          <row><cell>Systematic List of Outcomes</cell><cell>heads (H)<nbsp/>tails (T)</cell><cell>HH<nbsp/>HT<nbsp/>TH<nbsp/>TT</cell></row>
          <row><cell>Tree Diagram*</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row>
          <row><cell>Venn Diagram*</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row>
          <row><cell>Set Notation</cell><cell><m>S={H,T}</m></cell><cell><m>S={HH,HT,TH,TT}</m></cell></row>
        </tabular>
      </table>
      <p>*We will investigate tree diagrams and Venn diagrams in Section 3.5.</p>
      <p>Note—when represented as a set, the sample space is denoted with an uppercase <m>S</m>.</p>
      <p>An event is any combination of outcomes. It is a subset of the sample space, so uppercase letters like <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are commonly used to represent events. For example, if the experiment is to flip three fair coins, event <m>A</m> might be getting at most one head.</p>
      <p>The probability of an event <m>A</m> is written <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>), and <m>0\leqP(A)\leq1.P(A)=0</m> means the event <m>A</m> can never happen. <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>) = 1 means the event <m>A</m> always happens. 
<m>P(A)=0.5</m> means the event <m>A</m> is <alert>equally likely</alert> to occur or not to occur.</p>
      <figure xml:id="fs-id1164565359012">
        <image source="media/OSX_HS_Statistics_Figure_03_01_02_05.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>If two outcomes or events are equally likely, then they have equal probability. For example, if you toss a fair, six-sided die, each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is as likely to occur as any other face. If you toss a fair coin, a Head (<m>H</m>) and a Tail (<m>T</m>) are equally likely to occur. If you randomly guess the answer to a true/false question on an exam, you are equally likely to select a correct answer or an incorrect answer.</p>
      <p>To calculate the probability of an event <m>A</m> when all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely, count the number of outcomes for event <m>A</m> and divide by the total number of outcomes in the sample space. This is known as the theoretical probability of <m>A</m>.</p>
      <p><term>Theoretical Probability of Event A</term></p>
      <me>P(A)=\frac{\text{Number of outcomes in event A}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes.}}</me>
      <p>For example, if you toss a fair dime and a fair nickel, the sample space is {<em>HH, TH, HT, TT</em>} where <m>T</m> = tails and <m>H</m> = heads. The sample space has four outcomes. Let <m>A</m> represent the outcome <em>getting one head.</em> There are two outcomes that meet this condition {<em>HT, TH</em>}, so <m>P(A)=\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}=.5.</m></p>
      <p>Theoretical probability is not sufficient in all situations, however. Suppose we want to calculate the probability that a randomly selected car will run a red light at a given intersection. In this case, we need to look at events that <em>have</em> occurred, not theoretical possibilities. We could install a traffic camera and count the number of times that cars failed to stop when the light was red and the total number of cars that passed through the intersection for a period of time. These data will allow us to calculate the experimental, or empirical, probability that a car runs the red light.</p>
      <p><term>Experimental Probability of Event A</term></p>
      <me>P(A)=\frac{\text{Number of times event A occurs.}}{\text{Total number of trials}}</me>
      <p>While theoretical and experimental methods provide two different ways to calculate probability, these methods are closely related. If you flip one fair coin, there is one way to obtain heads and two possible outcomes. So, the theoretical probability of heads is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. Probability does not predict short-term results, however. If an experiment involves flipping a coin 10 times, you should not expect exactly five heads and five tails. The probability of any outcome measures the long-term relative frequency of that outcome. If you continue to flip the coin (from 20 to 2,000 to 20,000 times) the relative frequency of heads approaches .5 (the probability of heads).This important characteristic of probability experiments is known as the law of large numbers, which states that as the number of repetitions of an experiment is increased, the relative frequency obtained in the experiment tends to become closer and closer to the theoretical probability. Even though the outcomes do not happen according to any set pattern or order, overall, the long-term observed, or empirical, relative frequency will approach the theoretical probability.</p>
      <p>Suppose you roll one fair, six-sided die with the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} on its faces. Let event <m>E</m> = rolling a number that is at least five. There are two outcomes {5, 6}. <m>P(E)=\frac{2}{6}.</m> If you were to roll the die only a few times, you would not be surprised if your observed results did not match the probability. If you were to roll the die a very large number of times, you would expect that, overall, <m>\frac{2}{6}</m> of the rolls would result in an outcome of <em>at least five</em>. You would not expect exactly <m>\frac{2}{6}</m>, but the long-term relative frequency of obtaining this result would approach the theoretical probability of <m>\frac{2}{6}</m> as the number of repetitions grows larger and larger.</p>
      <p>It is important to realize that in many situations, the outcomes are not equally likely. A coin or die may be <term>unfair</term>, or biased. Two math professors in Europe had their statistics students test the Belgian one-euro coin and discovered that in 250 trials, a head was obtained 56 percent of the time and a tail was obtained 44 percent of the time. The data seem to show that the coin is not a fair coin; more repetitions would be helpful to draw a more accurate conclusion about such bias. Some dice may be biased. Look at the dice in a game you have at home; the spots on each face are usually small holes carved out and then painted to make the spots visible. Your dice may or may not be biased; it is possible that the outcomes may be affected by the slight weight differences due to the different numbers of holes in the faces. Gambling casinos make a lot of money depending on outcomes from rolling dice, so casino dice are made differently to eliminate bias. Casino dice have flat faces; the holes are completely filled with paint having the same density as the material that the dice are made out of so that each face is equally likely to occur. Later we will learn techniques to use to work with probabilities for events that are not equally likely.<nbsp/><nbsp/></p>
      <p>OR EventAn outcome is in the event <m>A</m> OR <m>B</m> if the outcome is in <m>A</m> or is in <m>B</m> or is in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. For example, let <m>A</m> = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and <m>B</m> = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. <m>A</m> OR <m>B</m> = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Notice that 4 and 5 are <alert>not</alert> listed twice.<nbsp/><nbsp/></p>
      <p>AND EventAn outcome is in the event <m>A</m> AND <m>B</m> if the outcome is in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> at the same time. For example, let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be <nbsp/>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, respectively. Then <m>A</m> AND <m>B</m> = {4, 5}.</p>
      <p>The <term>complement</term> of event <m>A</m> is denoted <m>A′</m> (read "<m>A</m> prime"). <m>A′</m> consists of all outcomes that are <alert>not</alert> in <m>A</m>. Notice that <nbsp/><m>P</m>(<m>A</m>) + <m>P</m>(<m>A′</m>) = 1. For example, let <m>S</m> = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and let <m>A</m> = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Then, <m>A′</m> = {5, 6}. <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>) = <m>\frac{4}{6}</m>, <m>P</m>(<m>A′</m>) = <m>\frac{2}{6}</m>, and <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>) + <m>P</m>(<m>A′</m>) = <m>\frac{4}{6}+\frac{2}{6}</m> = 1.</p>
      <p>The <term>conditional probability</term> of <m>A</m> given <m>B</m> is written <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>|<m>B</m>), read "the probability of <m>A</m>, given <m>B</m>." <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>|<m>B</m>) is the probability that event <m>A</m> will occur given that the event <m>B</m> has already occurred. A conditional probability reduces the sample space. We calculate the probability of <m>A</m> from the reduced sample space <m>B</m>. The formula to calculate <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>|<m>B</m>) is <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>|<m>B</m>) = <m>\frac{P(A\text{AND}B)}{P(B)}</m> where <m>P</m>(<m>B</m>) is greater than zero.</p>
      <p>For example, suppose we toss one fair, six-sided die. The sample space <m>S</m> = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let <m>A</m> = {2, 3} and <m>B</m> = {2, 4, 6}. <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>|<m>B</m>) represents the probability that a randomly selected outcome is in <em>A given that</em> it is in <m>B</m>. We know that the outcome must lie in <m>B</m>, so there are three possible outcomes. There is only one outcome in <m>B</m> that also lies in <m>A</m>, so <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>|<m>B</m>) = <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>.</p>
      <p>We get the same result by using the formula. Remember that <m>S</m> has six outcomes.</p>
      <p><m>P</m>(<m>A</m>|<m>B</m>) = <m>\frac{P(A\text{AND}B)}{P(B)}=\frac{\frac{(\text{the number of outcomes that are 2 or 3 and even in}S)}{6}}{\frac{(\text{the number of outcomes that are even in}S)}{6}}=\frac{\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{3}{6}}=\frac{1}{3}</m></p>
      <p>Understanding Terminology and SymbolsIt is important to read each problem carefully to think about and understand what the events are. Understanding the wording is the first very important step in solving probability problems. Reread the problem several times if necessary. Clearly identify the event of interest. Determine whether there is a condition stated in the wording that would indicate that the probability is conditional; carefully identify the condition, if any.</p>

      <title>Independent Events</title>
      <p>Two events are independent if the following are true:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><m>P</m>(<m>A</m>|<m>B</m>) = <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>)</li>
        <li><m>P</m>(<m>B</m>|<m>A</m>) = <m>P</m>(<m>B</m>)</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Two events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>independent events</term> if the knowledge that one occurred does not affect the chance the other occurs. For example, the outcomes of two roles of a fair die are independent events. The outcome of the first roll does not change the probability for the outcome of the second roll. To show two events are independent, you must show only one of the above conditions. If two events are <alert>not</alert> independent, then we say that they are dependent events.</p>
      <p>Sampling may be done with <term>replacement</term> or without replacement.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>With replacement: If each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, then that member has the possibility of being chosen more than once. When sampling is done with replacement, then events are considered to be independent, meaning the result of the first pick will not change the probabilities for the second pick.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A bag contains four blue and three white marbles. James draws one marble from the bag at random, records the color, and replaces the marble. The probability of drawing blue is <m>\frac{4}{7}</m>. When James draws a marble from the bag a second time, the probability of drawing blue is still <m>\frac{4}{7}</m>. James replaced the marble after the first draw, so there are still four blue and three white marbles.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Without replacement: When sampling is done without replacement, each member of a population may be chosen only once. In this case, the probabilities for the second pick are affected by the result of the first pick. The events are considered to be dependent or not independent.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The bag still contains four blue and three white marbles. Maria draws one marble from the bag at random, records the color, and sets the marble aside. The probability of drawing blue on the first draw is <m>\frac{4}{7}</m>. Suppose Maria draws a blue marble and sets it aside. When she draws a marble from the bag a second time, there are now <em>three</em> blue and three white marbles. So, the probability of drawing blue is now <m>\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}</m>. Removing the first marble without replacing it influences the probabilities on the second draw.</p>

      <p><m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>mutually exclusive</term> events if they cannot occur at the same time. This means that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> do not share any outcomes and <m>P</m>(<m>A</m> AND <m>B</m>) = 0.</p>
      <p>For example, suppose the sample space <m>S</m> = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.

Therefore, <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> are mutually exclusive.</p>
      <p>If it is not known whether <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are mutually exclusive, assume they are not until you can show otherwise. The following examples illustrate these definitions and terms.</p>

            <li>Let <m>B</m> = the event of getting all tails. <m>B</m> can be written as {<m>TT</m>}. <m>B</m> is the complement event of <m>A</m>, so <m>B</m> = <m>A′</m>. Also, <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>) + <m>P</m>(<m>B</m>) = <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>) + <m>P</m>(<m>A′</m>) = 1.</li>

      <p>Two events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent if the knowledge that one occurred does not affect the chance the other occurs. If two events are not independent, then we say that they are dependent</p>
      <p>In sampling with replacement, each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, so that member has the possibility of being chosen more than once, and the events are considered to be independent. In sampling without replacement, each member of a population may be chosen only once, and the events are considered not to be independent. When events do not share outcomes, they are mutually exclusive of each other.</p>

      <p>In calculating probability, there are two rules to consider when you are determining if two events are independent or dependent and if they are mutually exclusive or not.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="element-860">
      <title>The Multiplication Rule</title>
      <p>If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are two events defined on a <term>sample space</term>, then <m>P</m>(<m>A</m> AND <m>B</m>) = <m>P</m>(<m>B</m>)<m>P</m>(<m>A</m>|<m>B</m>).</p>
      <p>This equation can be rewritten as <m>P</m>(<m>A</m> AND <m>B</m>) = <m>P</m>(<m>B</m>)<m>P</m>(<m>A</m>|<m>B</m>), the multiplication rule.</p>
      <p>If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>independent</term>, then <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>|<m>B</m>) = <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>). In this special case, <m>P</m>(<m>A</m> AND <m>B</m>) = <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>|<m>B</m>)<m>P</m>(<m>B</m>) becomes <m>P</m>(<m>A</m> AND <m>B</m>) = <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>)<m>P</m>(<m>B</m>).</p>
      <p>A bag contains four green marbles, three red marbles, and two yellow marbles. Mark draws two marbles from the bag without replacement. The probability that he draws a yellow marble and then a green marble is</p>
      <me>P(\text{yellow and green})=P(\text{yellow})⋅P(\text{green | yellow}) \\  \\ =\frac{2}{9}⋅\frac{4}{8} \\ =\frac{1}{9}</me>
      <p>Notice that <m>P(\text{green | yellow})=\frac{4}{8}</m>. After the yellow marble is drawn, there are four green marbles in the bag and eight marbles in all.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="element-56">
      <title>The Addition Rule</title>
      <p>If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are defined on a sample space, then <m>P</m>(<m>A</m> OR <m>B</m>) = <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>) + <m>P</m>(<m>B</m>) − <m>P</m>(<m>A</m> AND <m>B</m>).</p>
      <p>Draw one card from a standard deck of playing cards. Let <m>H</m> = the card is a heart, and let <m>J</m> = the card is a jack. These events are not mutually exclusive because a card can be both a heart and a jack.</p>

      <p>If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>mutually exclusive</term>, then <m>P</m>(<m>A</m> AND <m>B</m>) = 0.

      <p>Draw one card from a standard deck of playing cards. Let <m>H</m> = the card is a heart and <m>S</m> = the card is a spade. These events are mutually exclusive because a card cannot be a heart and a spade at the same time. The probability that the card is a heart or a spade is</p>

            <li>Klaus can only afford one vacation. The probability that he chooses <m>A</m> is <m>P</m>(<m>A</m>) = .6 and the probability that he chooses <m>B</m> is <m>P</m>(<m>B</m>) = .35.</li>

          <p>Three professors at George Washington University did an experiment to determine if economists are more likely to return found money than other people. They dropped 64 stamped, addressed envelopes with $10 cash in different classrooms on the George Washington campus. Forty-four  percent were returned overall. From the economics classes 56 percent of the envelopes were returned. From the business, psychology, and history classes 31 percent were returned.</p>

            <li>Is money being returned independent of the class? Justify your answer numerically and explain it.</li>

            <li>No, whether the money is returned is not independent of which class the money was placed in. There are several ways to justify this mathematically, but one is that the money placed in economics classes is not returned at the same overall rate; <m>P</m>(<m>R</m>|<m>E</m>) ≠ <m>P</m>(<m>R</m>).</li>
            <li>No, this study definitely does not support that notion; in fact, it suggests the opposite. The money placed in the economics classrooms was returned at a higher rate than the money place in all classes collectively; <m>P</m>(<m>R</m>|<m>E</m>) &gt; <m>P</m>(<m>R</m>).</li>

    <title>Contingency Tables</title>


    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1164567287600">
      <p>A <term>two-way table</term> provides a way of portraying data that can facilitate calculating probabilities. When used to calculate probabilities, a two-way table is often called a <term>contingency table</term>. The table helps in determining conditional probabilities quite easily. The table displays sample values in relation to two different variables that may be dependent or contingent on one another. We used two-way tables in Chapters 1 and 2 to calculate marginal and conditional distributions. These tables organize data in a way that supports the calculation of relative frequency and, therefore, experimental (empirical) probability. Later on, we will use contingency tables again, but in another manner.</p>

            <li>Find <m>P</m>(Person uses a cell phone while driving <em>given</em> person had a violation in the last year).</li>
            <li>Find <m>P</m>(Person had no violation last year <em>given</em> person does not use a cell phone while driving).</li>

        <solution>
          <p>a. This is the same as the marginal distribution (<url href="m79594">Section 1.2</url>).</p>

          <p>c. Find the number of participants who satisfy <em>both</em> conditions.</p>
          <p>d. To find this probability, you need to identify how many participants use a cell phone while driving OR have no violation in the past year OR both.</p>

          <p>e. This is a conditional probability. You are <em>given</em> that the person had no violation in the last year, so you need only consider the values in that column of data.</p>
          <p>f. For this conditional probability, consider only values in the row labeled Does not use a cell phone while driving.</p>

An article in the New England Journal of Medicine, reported about a study of people who use a product in California and Hawaii. In one part of the report, the self-reported ethnicity and using the product levels per day were given. Of the people using the product at most 10 times a day, there were 9,886 African Americans, 2,745 Native Hawaiians, 12,831 Latinos, 8,378 Japanese Americans, and 7,650 whites. Of the people using the product 11 to 20 times per day, there were 6,514 African Americans, 3,062 Native Hawaiians, 4,932 Latinos, 10,680 Japanese Americans, and 9,877 whites. Of the people using the product 21 to 30 times per day, there were 1,671 African Americans, 1,419 Native Hawaiians, 1,406 Latinos, 4,715 Japanese Americans, and 6,062 Whites.

      <title>Tree Diagrams</title>
      <p>A <term>tree diagram</term> is a special type of graph used to determine the outcomes of an experiment. It consists of <em>branches</em> that are labeled with either frequencies or probabilities. Tree diagrams can make some probability problems easier to visualize and solve. The following example illustrates how to use a tree diagram:</p>
      <example xml:id="element-192">
        <statement>
          <p>a. List the 24 <m>BR</m> outcomes: <m>B</m>1<m>R</m>1, <m>B</m>1<m>R</m>2, <m>B</m>1<m>R</m>3, . . .</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>a. We know that there will be 24 different possible outcomes because there are eight ways to draw blue and three ways to draw red. Make a systematic list of possible outcomes that consist of a blue marble on the first draw and a red marble on the second draw.<nbsp/><nbsp/></p>

      <p>A tree diagram uses branches to show the different outcomes of experiments and makes complex probability questions easy to visualize.</p>
      <p>A Venn diagram is a picture that represents the outcomes of an experiment. It generally consists of a box that represents the sample space <m>S</m> together with circles or ovals. The circles or ovals represent events. A Venn diagram is especially helpful for visualizing the OR event, the AND event, and the complement of an event and for understanding conditional probabilities.</p>

Use the information from this table to complete <xref ref="table-theoretical-probabilities"/>. Next, put the candies in a cup. The experiment is to pick two candies, one at a time. Do <em>not</em> look into the cup as you pick them. The first time through, replace the first candy before picking the second one. Record the results in the With Replacement column of <xref ref="table-empirical-results"/>. Do this 24 times. The second time through, after picking the first candy, do <em>not</em> replace it before picking the second one. Then, pick the second one. Record the results in the Without Replacement column section of <xref ref="table-empirical-probabilities"/>. After you record the pick, put <em>both</em> candies back. Do this a total of 24 times, also. Use the data from <xref ref="table-empirical-probabilities"/> to calculate the empirical probability questions. Leave your answers in unreduced fractional form. Do <em>not</em> multiply out any fractions.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Why are the With Replacement and Without Replacement probabilities different?</li>
          <li>Convert <em>P</em>(no yellows) to decimal format for both Theoretical With Replacement and for Empirical With Replacement. Round to four decimal places.
            <ol>
              <li>Theoretical <em>With Replacement</em>: <em>P</em>(no yellows) = _______</li>
              <li>Empirical With Replacement: <em>P</em>(no yellows) = _______</li>
              <li>Are the decimal values <em>close</em>? Did you expect them to be closer together or farther apart? Why?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>If you increased the number of times you picked two candies to 240 times, why would empirical probability values change?</li>
          <li>Would this change (see Question 3) cause the empirical probabilities and theoretical probabilities to be closer together or farther apart? How do you know?</li>
          <li>Explain the differences in what <em>P</em>(<em>G</em><sub>1</sub> AND <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>) and <em>P</em>(<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>|<em>G</em><sub>2</sub>) represent. Hint: Think about the sample space for each probability.</li>
