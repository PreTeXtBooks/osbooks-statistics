    <title>A Population Proportion</title>


    <subsection xml:id="fs-id1169832959262">
      <p>During an election year, we see articles in the newspaper that state <term>confidence intervals</term> in terms of proportions or percentages. For example, a poll for a particular candidate running for president might show that the candidate has 40 percent of the vote within 3 percentage points  (if the sample is large enough). Often, election polls are calculated with 95 percent confidence, so the pollsters would be 95 percent confident that the true proportion of voters who favored the candidate would be between 0.37 and 0.43 (0.40 – 0.03, 0.40 + 0.03).</p>
      <p>Investors in the stock market are interested in the true proportion of stocks that go up and down each week. Businesses that sell personal computers are interested in the proportion of households in the United States that own personal computers. Confidence intervals can be calculated for the true proportion of stocks that go up or down each week and for the true proportion of households in the United States that own personal computers.</p>
      <p>The procedure to find the confidence interval, the sample size, the <term>error bound</term> <alert>for a population (<m>EBP</m>)</alert>, and the <term>confidence level</term> for a proportion is similar to that for the population mean, but the formulas are different.</p>
      <p>How do you know you are dealing with a proportion problem? First, the data that you are collecting is categorical, consisting of two categories: Success or Failure, Yes or No. Examples of situations where you are the following trying to estimate the true population proportion are the following: What proportion of the population smoke? What proportion of the population will vote for candidate A? What proportion of the population has a college-level education?</p>
      <p>The distribution of the sample proportions (based on samples of size <m>n</m>) is denoted by <m>P′</m> (read “P prime”).</p>
      <p>The central limit theorem for proportions asserts that the sample proportion distribution <m>P′</m> follows a normal distribution with mean value <m>p</m>, and standard deviation <m>\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}</m>, where <m>p</m> is the population proportion and <m>q</m> = 1 - <m>p</m>.</p>
      <p>The confidence interval has the form (<m>p′</m> – <m>EBP</m>, <m>p′</m> + <m>EBP</m>). <m>EBP</m> is error bound for the proportion.</p>
      <me>p′\text{=}\frac{x}{n}</me>
      <p><m>p′</m> = the <em>estimated proportion</em> of successes (<m>p′</m> is a <em>point estimate</em> for <m>p</m>, the true proportion.)</p>
      <p><m>x</m> = the <em>number</em> of successes</p>
      <p><m>n</m> = the size of the sample</p>
      <p><em>The error bound for a proportion is</em></p>
      <p><m>EBP=(z_{\frac{α}{2}})(\sqrt{\frac{p^{′}q^{′}}{n}})\text{,}</m> where <m>q′</m> = 1 – <m>p′</m>.</p>
      <p>This formula is similar to the error bound formula for a mean, except that the "appropriate standard deviation" is different. For a mean, when the population standard deviation is known, the appropriate standard deviation that we use is <m>\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m>. For a proportion, the appropriate standard deviation is <m>\sqrt{pqn}</m>.</p>
      <p>However, in the error bound formula, we use
  <m>\sqrt{\frac{p^{′}q^{′}}{n}}</m> as the standard deviation, instead of <m>\sqrt{pqn}</m>.</p>
      <p>In the error bound formula, the <em>sample proportions <m>p′</m> and <m>q′</m>, are estimates of the unknown population proportions <m>p</m> and <m>q</m></em>. The estimated proportions <m>p′</m> and <m>q′</m> are used because <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are not known. The sample proportions <m>p′</m> and <m>q′</m> are calculated from the data: <m>p′</m> is the estimated proportion of successes, and <m>q′</m> is the estimated proportion of failures.</p>
      <p>The confidence interval can be used only if the number of successes <em>np′</em> and the number of failures <em>nq′</em> are both greater than five.</p>
      <p>That is, in order to use the formula for confidence intervals for proportions, you need to verify that both <m>np^{'}\geq5</m> and <m>nq^{'}\geq5</m>.</p>

        <statement>
          <p>Suppose that a market research firm is hired to estimate the percentage of adults living in a large city who have cell phones. Five hundred randomly selected adult residents in this city are surveyed to determine whether they have cell phones. Of
  the 500 people surveyed, 421 responded yes, they own cell phones. Using a 95 percent confidence level, compute a confidence interval estimate for the true proportion of adult residents of this city who have cell phones.</p>

        <solution>
          <p>Let <m>X</m> = the number of people in the sample who have cell phones. <m>X</m> is binomial. <m>X\simB(500,\frac{421}{500})</m>.</p>
          <p>To calculate the confidence interval, you must find <m>p′</m>, <m>q′</m>, and <m>EBP</m>.</p>
          <p><m>n</m> = 500</p>

          <p><m>p′</m> = 0.842 is the sample proportion; this is the point estimate of the population proportion.</p>
          <p>Because <m>CL</m> = 0.95, then <m>α</m> = 1 – <m>CL</m> = 1 – 0.95 = 0.05 <m>(\frac{α}{2})</m> = 0.025.</p>

Remember that the area to the right of <m>z</m>_{0.025}is 0.025, and the area to the left of <m>z</m>_{0.025}is 0.975. This can also be found using appropriate commands on other calculators, using a computer, or using a standard normal probability table.</p>
          <p>The confidence interval for the true binomial population proportion is (<m>p′</m> – <m>EBP</m>, <m>p′</m> + <m>EBP</m>) = (0.810, 0.874).</p>

    <subsection xml:id="eip-443">
      <p>There is a certain amount of error introduced into the process of calculating a confidence interval for a proportion. Because we do not know the true proportion for the population, we are forced to use point estimates to calculate the appropriate standard deviation of the sampling distribution. Studies have shown that the resulting estimation of the standard deviation can be flawed.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, there is a simple adjustment that allows us to produce more accurate confidence intervals: We simply pretend that we have four additional observations. Two of these observations are successes, and two are failures. The new sample size, then, is <m>n</m> + 4, and the new count of successes is <m>x</m> + 2.</p>
      <p>Computer studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the <alert>plus-four confidence interval for <m>p</m> method</alert>. It should be used when the confidence level desired is at least 90 percent and the sample size is at least ten.</p>

          <p>Suppose a mobile phone company wants to determine the current percentage of customers ages 50+ who use text messaging on their cell phones. How many customers ages 50+ should the company survey in order to be 90 percent confident that the estimated (sample) proportion is within 3 percentage points of the true population proportion of customers ages 50+ who use text messaging on their cell phones?

      <title>Chapter Review</title>
      <p>Some statistical measures, like many survey questions, measure qualitative rather than quantitative data. In this case, the population parameter being estimated is a proportion. It is possible to create a confidence interval for the true population proportion by following procedures similar to those used in creating confidence intervals for population means. The formulas are slightly different, but they follow the same reasoning.</p>
      <p>Let <m>p′</m> represent the sample proportion, <em>x/n</em>, where <m>x</m> represents the number of successes, and <m>n</m> represents the sample size. Let <m>q′</m> = 1 – <m>p′</m>. Then the confidence interval for a population proportion is given by the following formula:</p>
      <p>(lower bound, upper bound) <m>=(p^{′}-EBP,p^{′}+EBP)=(p^{′}-z\sqrt{\frac{p^{′}q^{′}}{n}},p^{′}+z\sqrt{\frac{p^{′}q^{′}}{n}})\text{.}</m></p>
      <p>The <alert>plus–four method</alert> for calculating confidence intervals is an attempt to balance the error introduced by using estimates of the population proportion when calculating the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. Simply imagine four additional trials in the study; two are successes and two are failures. Calculate <m>p^{′}=\frac{x+2}{n+4}</m>, and proceed to find the confidence interval. When sample sizes are small, this method has been demonstrated to provide more accurate confidence intervals than the standard formula used for larger samples.</p>

      Which distribution should you use for this problem? Explain your choice.
  Construct a 95 percent confidence interval for the population proportion of adult Americans who believe that crime is the main problem.
   
State the confidence interval.
Sketch the graph.
Calculate the error bound.
  
Suppose we want to lower the sampling error. What is one way to accomplish that?
The sampling error given by the group of researchers who conducted the poll is ±3 percent. In one to three complete sentences, explain what the ±3 percent represents.
    
 
   <m>X</m> = the number of adult Americans who believe that crime is the main problem; <m>P′</m> = the proportion of adult Americans who believe that crime is the main problem.
    Because we are estimating a proportion, that <m>P′</m> = 0.2 and <m>n</m> = 1,000, the distribution we should use is <m>N(0.2,\sqrt{\frac{(0.2)(0.8)}{1000}})</m>.

    One way to lower the sampling error is to increase the sample size.
    The stated <em>± 3 percent</em> represents the maximum error bound. This means that those doing the study are reporting a maximum error of 3 percent. Thus, they estimate the percentage of adult Americans who the percentage of adult Americans who that crime is the main problem to be between 18 percent and 22 percent.</p>

          <li>The actual population mean for the 100 heights given in  is <m>μ</m> = 63.4. Using the class listing of confidence intervals, count how many of them contain the population mean <m>μ</m>; i.e., for how many intervals does the value of <m>μ</m> lie between the endpoints of the confidence interval?</li>
          <li>Divide this number by the total number of confidence intervals generated by the class to determine the percentage of confidence intervals that contain the mean <m>μ</m>. Write that percentage here: _____________.</li>
          <li>Is the percentage of confidence intervals that contain the population mean <m>μ</m> close to 90 percent?</li>
          <li>Suppose we had generated 100 confidence intervals. What do you think would happen to the percentage of confidence intervals that contained the population mean?</li>
          <li>When we construct a 90 percent confidence interval, we say that we are <em>90 percent confident that the true population mean lies within the confidence interval. </em>Using complete sentences, explain what we mean by this phrase.</li>
          <li>Some students think that a 90 percent confidence interval contains 90 percent of the data. Use the list of data given (the heights of women) and count how many of the data values lie within the confidence interval that you generated based on that data. How many of the 100 data values lie within your confidence interval? What percentage is this? Is this percentage close to 90 percent?</li>
          <li>Explain why it does not make sense to count data values that lie in a confidence interval. Think about the random variable that is being used in the problem.</li>
          <li>Suppose you obtained the heights of 10 women and calculated a confidence interval from this information. Without knowing the population mean <m>μ</m>, would you have any way of knowing <em>for certain</em> whether your interval actually contained the value of <m>μ</m>? Explain.</li>
